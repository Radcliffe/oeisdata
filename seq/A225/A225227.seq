%N A225227 The n X n X n dots problem: minimal number of straight lines (connected at their endpoints) required to pass through n^3 dots arranged in an n X n X n grid, without exiting from the box [0, n] X [0, n] X [0, n].
%C A225227 A generalization of the well-known "Nine Dots Problem", where the regular axis-aligned bounding box (RAABB:=[0, n] X [0, n] X [0, n]) has been declared.
%C A225227 From _Marco Ripà_, Aug 10 2020: (Start)
%C A225227 In particular, if we loosen the constraint on the allowed AABB, covering paths characterized by a shorter link-length can be found, such as 5 <= a(2) <= 6, where the aforementioned upper bound has been discovered by Koki Goma in August 2021, providing the self-crossing covering path (0,0,0)-(2,2,0)-(1/2,1/2,3/2)-(2,-1,0)-(0,1,0)-(0,1,1)-(0,0,1).
%C A225227 Moreover, the above pattern suggests different uncrossing covering paths of the same link-length, such as (1,0,0)-(0,0,0)-(2,2,2)-(1/2,-1,1/2)-(-1/2,1,3/2)-(1,1,0)-(1,1,0) and also the (self-crossing) covering path (1,0,0)-(0,0,0)-(0,1,0)-(3/2,1,3/2)-(1/2,-1,1/2)-(-1/2,1,3/2)-(1,1,0) which is entirely contained inside a box of 1.5 X 2 X 2 units^3 but which does not match the RAABB.

%e A225227 For n = 2, a(2) = 7. You cannot touch the 8 vertices of a cube using fewer than 7 straight lines and without exiting from the box [0, 2] X [0, 2] X [0, 2], following the "Nine Dots Puzzle" basic rules.

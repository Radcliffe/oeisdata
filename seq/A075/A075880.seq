%N A075880 Position of the circles around (0,0) that contain record numbers of lattice points in the list of all circles around (0,0) that pass through lattice points, ordered by increasing radius.
%C A075880 The first terms of this sequence were given by James Buddenhagen in a sci.math posting on May 05 2002 entitled "Circle with 3 lattice points"

%F A075880 a(n) = k-1 for which A001481(k) = A071383(n).
%F A075880 lim n ->infinity a(n) = k_LR * exp(n) / n^(1/2), where k_LR is the Landau-Ramanujan constant 0.764223653... (A064533)
%e A075880 a(4)=13 because A001481(14) = A071383(4)=25.

%N A246167 Positions where distinct new values of A246271 appear for the first time.
%C A246167 As this is the sequence A246280 sorted into ascending order, this is also expected to grow roughly as a(n) ~ 2^(n-1). (In this sequence we use one-based indexing.) Please see comments in A246280.
%C A246167 The corresponding new values at A246271(a(n)) are 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 5, 3, 4, 11, 8, 10, 9, 15, 14, 13, 12, 17, 21, 20, 19, 18, 16, 24, 23, 22, ... (which is a permutation of the nonnegative integers).

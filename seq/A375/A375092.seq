%N A375092 Number of permutations p of the multiset {0,0,1,1,2,2,...,n,n} such that p(1) = 0, p(2n+2) = n, and |p(i) - p(i-1)| is always 1 or 2.
%C A375092 Imagine you're a whimsical little creature standing on the number line. You start at 0, and you can take steps with some constraints:
%C A375092   1. You must always stay between 0 and some positive integer endpoint n (inclusive).
%C A375092   2. You can only take steps of size 1 or 2 (not 0), forward or backward.
%C A375092 Your journey as a whole must also follow some constraints:
%C A375092   3. You must end at n.
%C A375092   4. You must stand on each integer between 0 and n (inclusive) exactly twice.
%C A375092 Starting at 0 counts as standing on 0 once, meaning you have to revisit it once. Ending on n means you visit n at the end, so you must therefore visit it once sometime during your journey and then return at the end.
%C A375092 a(n) is the number of distinct paths following these constraints from 0 to n.

%N A091799 a(1) = 3. To get a(n+1), write the string a(1)a(2)...a(n) as xy^k for words x and y (where y has positive length) and k is maximized, i.e., k = the maximal number of repeating blocks at the end of the sequence so far. Then a(n+1) = max(k,3).
%C A091799 Here xy^k means the concatenation of the words x and k copies of y.
%C A091799 The first '5' appears at step 343. At which step does the first '6' appear? - _Sergio Pimentel_, Jul 13 2015
%C A091799 The first '6' appears at about 4.33*10^616, see FORMULA for exact value. The positions where record lengths of strings 5 and 6 occur can be computed via sequence A091844, see PARI code there. - _M. F. Hasler_, Sep 29 2018
%C A091799 This sequence is the concatenation of the "glue strings" of sequence A091787, just like sequence A091844 is the concatenation of the glue strings of this sequence. - _M. F. Hasler_, Oct 04 2018

%F A091799 From _M. F. Hasler_, Sep 29 2018: (Start)
%F A091799 The first '5' appears at position 343 which in hexadecimal is 1x, with x = 57 (in base 16).
%F A091799 The first two consecutive '5's appear at positions 5760309085..5760309086, which is {-1..0} + 1y in hexadecimal, where y = xxxx + 7.
%F A091799 Then '55' occurs again at positions {-1..0} + 1yy in hexadecimal, etc.
%F A091799 The first three consecutive '5's appear at positions 1z + {-2..0} in hexadecimal, where z = yyyy + 20 (in base 16).
%F A091799 Then '555' occurs again at positions {-2..0} + 1zz in hexadecimal, etc.
%F A091799 The first occurrence of '5555' is at positions {-4..-1} + 1w in hexadecimal, where w = zzzz + 98 (in base 16).
%F A091799 '555' also occurs again at positions {-2..0} + 1w'z in hexadecimal, where 'z = 'yyyy + 20, 'y = 'xxxx + 7 and 'x = x - 1 = 56 (in base 16), and also at positions {-2..0} + 1w'zz in hexadecimal, and at positions {-2..0} + 1w'zzz in hexadecimal.
%F A091799 Then '5555' occurs again at positions {-4..-1} + 1w'w in hexadecimal, where 'w = 'zzzz + 98 (in base 16).
%F A091799 '555' also occurs again at positions {-2..0} + 1w'w'z in hexadecimal, etc.
%F A091799 '5555' also occurs again at positions {-3..0} + 1w'w'w in hexadecimal, and at positions {-4..-1} + 1w'w'w'w in hexadecimal.
%F A091799 The first occurrence of a '6' (immediately after the first '55555', followed by a sixth '5') is at position 1w'w'w'w + 30E in hexadecimal, which equals 782 + 16^510*257 + (16^512-1)/(16^128-1)*(158 - 16^126 + (16^128-1)/(16^32-1)*(32 + (16^32-1)/(16^8-1)*(7 + (16^8-1)/255*87))). (End)

%N A145363 Partition number array, called M31hat(-2).
%C A145363 If all positive numbers are replaced by 1 this becomes the characteristic partition array for partitions with parts 1,2 or 3 only, provided the partitions of n are ordered like in Abramowitz-Stegun (A-St order; for the reference see A134278).
%C A145363 Second member (K=2) in the family M31hat(-K) of partition number arrays.
%C A145363 The sequence of row lengths is A000041 (partition numbers) [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 22, 30, 42,...].
%C A145363 This array is array A144358 divided entrywise by the array M_3=M3(1)=A036040. Formally 'A144358/A036040'. E.g. a(4,3)= 4 = 12/3 = A144358(4,3)/A036040(4,3).
%C A145363 If M31hat(-2;n,k) is summed over those k belonging to partitions with fixed number of parts m one obtains the unsigned triangle S1hat(-2):= A145364.

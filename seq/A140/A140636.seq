%N A140636 Number of connected graphs on n unlabeled nodes that contain at least two cycles.
%C A140636 Original name: number of unlabeled complex components with n nodes.
%C A140636 We can find in "The Birth of the Giant Component", p. 2, see the first link:
%C A140636 "As each of the random graphs evolved, the story went, never once was there more than a single 'complex' component; i.e. there never were two or more components present simultaneously that were neither trees nor unicyclic."
%C A140636 So a complex component is a connected graph that is neither a tree nor an unicyclic graph.

%N A296185 Numbers that are not the sum of 3 squares and an 8th power.
%C A296185 When m is in this sequence, 9m and m^9 are also in this sequence.
%C A296185 For nonnegative integers a, b, k, n, x, y, z and w, n = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^8 if and only if n is not of the form 4^(4k + 2) * (8b + 7).
%C A296185 1. If n is not of the form 4^a * (8b + 7), then it follows from Legendre's three-square theorem that the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^8 = n has a solution with w = 0.
%C A296185 2. If n = 4^a * (8b + 7), then (c, d and j are nonnegative integers):
%C A296185 (1) If a = 4k, then n - (2^k)^8 = 4^(4k) * (8b + 6), and the equation has a solution with w = 2^k.
%C A296185 (2) If a = 4k + 1, then n - (2^k)^8 = 4^(4k) * (32b + 27) is of the form 4^c * (8d + 3), and the equation has a solution with w = 2^k.
%C A296185 (3) If a = 4k + 3, then n - (2^(k + 1))^8 = 4^a * (8b + 3), and the equation has a solution with w = 2^(k + 1).
%C A296185 (4) If a = 4k + 2 and w = 2j + 1, then n == 0 (mod 8), w^8 == 1 (mod 8), and n - w^8 is number of the form 8c + 7. I.e., the equation does not have a solution with w odd.
%C A296185 If a = 4k + 2 and w = 4j + 2, then n - w^8 = 16 * (4^(4k) * (8b + 7) - 16 * (2j + 1)^8) = 4^4 * (4^(4k - 4) * (8b + 7) - (2j + 1)^8). When k = 0, n - w^8 is a number of the form 16 * (8c + 7); when k > 0, n - w^8 is a number of the form 4^4 * (8d + 7). Therefore, the equation does not have a solution with w = 4j + 2. Similarly, it can be proved that there is no solution with w = 4j.

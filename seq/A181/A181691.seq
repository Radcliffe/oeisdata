%N A181691 Numbers k such that Fibonacci(k) has exactly two 1's.
%C A181691 No more terms < 10000. Is the sequence finite?
%C A181691 No more terms < 100000. - _Harvey P. Dale_, Apr 02 2012
%C A181691 From _David A. Corneth_, Sep 04 2025: (Start)
%C A181691 Probably finite and full given the number of ones tends to increase (cf. A085855) and the terms must be too large given the expected number of ones way over 2.
%C A181691 No more terms < 10^7.
%C A181691 Generally for n > 306 it is enough to check the last 150 digits of Fibonacci(k) to find more than two 1's. For k = 355 we have Fibonacci(k) has only one digit 1.
%C A181691 To check all candidates < 10^7 it was needed to check the last 204 digits to find more than 2 ones if there were more than 2 ones as Fibonacci(1650886) has the third one from the right at 10^203. (End)
%e A181691 From _David A. Corneth_, Sep 04 2025: (Start)
%e A181691 56 is in the sequence as Fibonacci(56) = 225851433717 which has exactly two ones.
%e A181691 307 is not in the sequence as Fibonacci(307) ends in 109298792472139250504213 which has three 1's.
%e A181691 355 is not in the sequence as it has exactly one 1. (End)

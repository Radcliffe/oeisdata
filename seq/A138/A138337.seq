%N A138337 Positions of digits after decimal point of number Pi where the approximation to the number Pi by a root of a polynomial of 3 degree does not improve the accuracy.
%C A138337 If there is a set of consecutive numbers in this sequence starting at k, this means that k-1 is a good approximation to Pi.
%C A138337 If the set of successive integers is longer that approximation k-1 better (see A138338)
%C A138337 This sequence appears to be ill defined: There are many different polynomials of degree 3 that give an approximation of Pi with the same precision, and any such approximation to n+1 digits is also an approximation of Pi to n digits, so the sequence should be empty. - _M. F. Hasler_, May 21 2025

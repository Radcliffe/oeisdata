%N A079611 Waring's problem: conjectured values for G(n), the smallest number m such that every sufficiently large number is the sum of at most m n-th powers of positive integers.
%C A079611 The only certain values are G(1) = 1, G(2) = 4 and G(4) = 16.
%C A079611 See A002804 for the simpler problem of Waring's original conjecture, which does not restrict the bound to "sufficiently large" numbers. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jun 29 2014

%e A079611 It is known that every sufficiently large number is the sum of 16 fourth powers, and 16 is the smallest number with this property, so a(4) = G(4) = 16. (The numbers 16^k*31 are not the sum of fewer than 16 fourth powers.)

%N A298804 Triangle T(n,k) (1 <= k <= n) read by rows: A046936 with rows reversed and offset changed to 1.
%C A298804 This is another version of Moser's version (A046936) of Aitken's array (A011971).
%C A298804 Although offset 0 is better for A011971 and A046936, for this version offset 1 is more appropriate.
%C A298804 Comments from _Don Knuth_, Jan 29 2018 (Start):
%C A298804 a(n,k) is the number of set partitions (i.e. equivalence classes) in which (i) 1 is not equivalent to 2, ..., nor k; and (ii) the last part, when parts are ordered by their smallest element, has size 1; (iii) that last part isn't simply "1". (Equivalently, n>1.)
%C A298804 It's not difficult to prove this characterization of a(k,n). For example, if we know that there are 22 partitions of {1,2,3,4,5} with 1 inequivalent to 2, and 6 partitions of {1,2,3,4} with
%C A298804 1 inequivalent to 2, then there are 6 partitions of {1,2,3,4,5} with 1 inequivalent to 2 and 1 equivalent to 3. Hence there are 16 with 1 equivalent to neither 2 nor 3.
%C A298804 The same property, but leaving out conditions (ii) and (iii), characterizes Pierce's triangular array A123346.  (End)

%N A358062 a(n) is the diagonal domination number for the queen graph on an n X n chessboard.
%C A358062 a(n) is the smallest number of queens that can be placed on the diagonal of an n X n chessboard attacking all the cells on the chessboard. For large n the diagonal domination number exceeds the domination number.
%C A358062 The diagonal dominating set can be described by the set X of the x-coordinates of all the queens. Cockayne and Hedetniemi showed that for n greater than 1, set X has to be the complement to a midpoint-free even-sum set. Here midpoint-free means that the set doesn't contain an average of any two of its elements. Even-sum means that each sum of a pair of elements is even. Thus the problem of finding the diagonal domination number is equivalent to finding a largest midpoint-free even-sum set in the range 1-n.
%C A358062 a(n) agrees with the connected domination number up to at least n = 11. - _Eric W. Weisstein_, Mar 12 2025

%F A358062 For n > 1, a(n) = n - A003002(ceiling(n/2)). - _Eric W. Weisstein_, Mar 07 2025
%e A358062 Consider a 9 X 9 chessboard. The largest midpoint-free even-sum set has size 4. For example: 1, 3, 7, and 9 form such a subset. Thus, the queen's position diagonal domination number is 5 and queens can be placed on the diagonal in rows 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8 to dominate the board.
%Y A358062 Cf. A003002 (size of largest Salem-Spencer set in [1..n]).
%Y A358062 Cf. A373394 (numbers of minimum connected dominating sets for n X n queen graph).

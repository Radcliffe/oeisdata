%N A099584 Exponent of 3 in factorization of prime(n) - 1.
%C A099584 By Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions, the asymptotic density of primes p such that p == 1 (mod 3^k) within all the primes is 1/(2*3^(k-1)), for k >= 1. This is also the asymptotic density of terms in this sequence that are >= k. Therefore, the asymptotic density of the occurrences of k in this sequence is d(k) = 1/(2*3^(k-1)) - 1/(2*3^k) = 1/3^k, and the asymptotic mean of this sequence is Sum_{k>=1} k*d(k) = 3/4. - _Amiram Eldar_, Mar 14 2025

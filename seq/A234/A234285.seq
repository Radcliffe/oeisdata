%N A234285 Positive odd numbers n such that sigma(m) - 2m is never equal to n, where sigma(.) is the sum of divisors function A000203. Conjectural.
%C A234285 The terms shown here are conjectural, based on a search up to 10^20 made by Davis et al. (2013).
%C A234285 Comments from _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Jan 12 2014: (Start)
%C A234285 1. Mersenne primes are not in this sequence. Because if M=2^p-1 is prime then M=sigma(m)-2m, where m=2^(p-1)*(2^p-1)^2=(1/2)*(M+1)*M^2 (please see Proposition 2.1 of Firoozbakht-Hasler, 2010).
%C A234285 2. If M = 2^p - 1 is a Mersenne prime then M^2 + 3M + 1 = 4^p + 2^p - 1 is not in the sequence. Because M^2 + 3M + 1 = sigma(m) - 2m where m = M^3 + M^2 = 2^p(2^p-1)^2 (please see Proposition 2.5, op. cit.).
%C A234285 Examples:
%C A234285 p = 2, M = 3, 4^p + 2^p - 1 = 19, m = M^3 + M^2 = 2^p(2^p-1)^2 = 36; sigma(m) - 2m = 19
%C A234285 p = 3, M = 7, 4^p + 2^p - 1 = 71, m = M^3 + M^2 = 2^p(2^p-1)^2 = 392; sigma(m) - 2m = 71
%C A234285 3. Note that if r is an even number and if for a number k p = 2^k - r - 1 is an odd prime then r = sigma(m) - 2m where m = 2^(k-1)*p. Namely r is not in the sequence (see Theorem 1.1, op. cit.).
%C A234285 It seems that for each even number r, there exists at least one odd prime of the form 2^k - r - 1. This means there is no even term in the sequence.
%C A234285 Moreover I conjecture that, for each even number r, there exist infinitely many primes p of the form 2^k - r - 1, or equivalently, I conjecture that: For each odd number s, there exists infinitely many primes p of the form 2^k - s.
%C A234285 Special cases:
%C A234285 (i): s = 1, there exist infinitely many Mersenne primes.
%C A234285 (ii): s = -1, there exist infinitely many Fermat primes.
%C A234285 (iii): s = 3, sequence A050414 is infinite.
%C A234285 (iv): s = -3, sequence A057732 is infinite.
%C A234285 (v): s = -5, sequence A059242 is infinite.
%C A234285 and so on. (End)
%C A234285 Cohen (1983) showed that 203^2 is not a term since sigma(m) - 2*m = 203^2 has a solution m = 742^2. - _Max Alekseyev_, Aug 29 2025

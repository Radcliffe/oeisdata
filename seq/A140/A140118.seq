%N A140118 Extrapolation for (n + 1)-st odd prime made by fitting least-degree polynomial to first n odd primes.
%C A140118 Construct the least-degree polynomial p(x) which fits the first n odd primes (p has degree n - 1 or less). Then predict the next prime by evaluating prime(n + 1).
%C A140118 Can anything be said about the pattern of positive and negative values?
%C A140118 How many of these terms are the correct (n + 1)th prime?
%C A140118 How many terms are prime?
%C A140118 The terms at indices 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 13, 17, 20, 24, 32, 54, 75, 105, 283, 676, 769, 1205 and 1300 actually are prime (ignoring negative signs).

%F A140118 a(n) = Sum_{i=1..n} prime(i+1)*(-1)^(n-i)*binomial(n, i-1).
%e A140118 The lowest-order polynomial having points (1,3), (2,5), (3,7) and (4,11) is f(x) = 1/3 (x^3 - 6x^2 + 17x - 3). When evaluated at x = 5, f(5) = 19.

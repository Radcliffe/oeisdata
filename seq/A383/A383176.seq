%N A383176 If p is a prime such that p = x^2 + y^2, then k is the largest integer that satisfies that x^2 + y^2 - k*x*y > 0.
%C A383176 Fermat's Christmas theorem states that if p = 2 or if p is congruent to 1 modulo 4 (A002313), then p is written as a sum of 2 squares uniquely. Thus, if A002313(n) = x^2 + y^2, for certain integers x and y, then a(n) is the largest integer k such that x^2 + y^2 - k*x*y > 0.
%C A383176 a(n) >= 2, for n > 1. If p > 2 and p = x^2 + y^2, since x != y, then it is satisfied that 0 < (x - y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 2x*y < x^2 + y^2 - x*y. The equality a(n) = 2 is given when |x - y| < phi*min{x, y}.
%e A383176 Since A002313(8) = 53 and 53 = 2^2 + 7^2, we have that 53 - 3*2*7 > 0 and 53 - 4*2*7 < 0, then a(8) = 3.

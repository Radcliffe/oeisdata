%N A288568 Number of non-isomorphic connected arrangements of n pseudo-circles on a sphere, in the sense that the union of the pseudo-circles is a connected set, reduced for mirror symmetry.
%C A288568 These counts have been reduced for mirror symmetry. Computed up to n=5 by Jon Wild and Christopher Jones and communicated to N. J. A. Sloane on August 31 2016. Definition corrected Dec 10 2017 thanks to Manfred Scheucher, who has computed same result with Stefan Felsner independently.
%C A288568 The list of arrangements is available online on the Homepage of Pseudocircles (see below) and a detailed description for the enumeration can be found in Arrangements of Pseudocircles: On Circularizability (see below). - _Manfred Scheucher_, Dec 11 2017

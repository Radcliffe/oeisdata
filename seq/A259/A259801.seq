%N A259801 Numbers such that it and its two neighbors are products of 8 distinct primes.
%C A259801 A subsequence of A169834.
%C A259801 With bound set at 4*10^14, the linked-to PARI program completed its run in about 2 days (producing 48 terms). The program fixes prospective smallest 4 prime factors so their product is at or above the minimum possible of the largest of 3 products of 4 primes without overlap (A260075(4)=20553), doing bound-restricted testing for the larger 4 in turn for each of these smaller quadruples. This is just one of a variety of ways of fixing a prospective trio by specifying one member as being within a certain range and satisfying the criterion. The program mostly avoids duplicates but does not entirely. See the part of the corresponding program at A259350 immediately before the print command for a fix.
%C A259801 The efficiency the program seems to generate empirically would come from the specification of product of 4 smaller primes as greater than a certain value and whole product within a certain range. Running through all even products of 8 distinct primes between the cube root of the (3n)-th primorial and the bound given would be a simpler way but one not so statistically limited (with a proportionally larger number of candidates). Note: The author is not making a claim of maximal efficiency, just of marked improvements over some simpler approaches.
%C A259801 a(1)=A093550(8).

%N A128704 Number of groups of order A128703(n).
%C A128704 Number of groups for orders of form 5^k*p, where 1 <= k <= 5 and p is a prime different from 5.
%C A128704 The groups of these orders (up to A128703(69556991) = 5368708945 in version V2.13-4) form a class contained in the Small Groups Library of MAGMA.

%F A128704 a(n) = A000001(A128703(n)).
%e A128704 A128703(20) = 275 and there are 4 groups of order 275 (A000001(275) = 4), hence a(20) = 4.

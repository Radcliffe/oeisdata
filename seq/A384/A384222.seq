%N A384222 Irregular triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the length of the k-th sublist of divisors of n whose terms increase by a factor of at most 2, with n >= 1, k >= 1.
%C A384222 T(n,k) is the number of terms in the k-th sublist of divisors of n such that the ratio of adjacent divisors in every sublist is at most 2.
%C A384222 In a sublist of divisors of n the terms are in increasing order and two adjacent terms are the same two adjacent terms in the list of divisors of n.
%C A384222 Row n has only one term, which is A000005(n), if and only if n is in A174973.
%C A384222 Conjecture 1: row n is a palindromic composition of A000005(n).
%C A384222 If the conjecture is true then this triangle should be a companion of A237270 in the sense that here the n-th row should be a palindromic composition of sigma_0(n) = A000005(n) and the n-th row of A237270 is a palindromic composition of sigma_1(n) = A000203(n).
%C A384222 A384149(n,k) is the sum of the terms in the k-th sublist of divisors of n. In the comments of A384149 it is conjectured that the row lengths of that triangle give A237271. If that conjecture is true then here the row lengths should also be A237271 and therefore A237271(n) could be defined also as the number of sublists of divisors of n whose terms increase by a factor of at most 2.

%e A384222 For n = 14 the list of divisors of 14 is [1, 2, 7, 14]. There are two sublists of divisors of 14 whose terms increase by a factor of at most 2, they are [1, 2] and [7, 14]. Each sublist has two terms, so the row 14 is [2, 2].
%e A384222 For n = 15 the list of divisors of 15 is [1, 3, 5, 15]. There are three sublists of divisors of 15 whose terms increase by a factor of at most 2, they are [1], [3, 5], [15]. The number of terms in the sublists are [1, 2, 1] respectively, so the row 15 is [1, 2, 1].
%e A384222 For n = 16 the list of divisors of 16 is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16]. There is only one sublist of divisors of 16 whose terms increase by a factor of at most 2, that is the same as the list of divisors of 16, which has five terms, so the row 16 is [5].
%e A384222 For n = 2350 the list of divisors of 2350 is [1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 47, 50, 94, 235, 470, 1175, 2350]. There are five sublists of divisors of 2350 whose terms increase by a factor of at most 2, they are [1, 2], [5, 10], [25, 47, 50, 94], [235, 470], [1175, 2350]. The number of terms in the sublists are [2, 2, 4, 2, 2] respectively, so the row 2350 is [2, 2, 4, 2, 2].

%N A227156 Number of ways to write n as a sum of a square and half of a term of the sequence A008407.
%C A227156 Conjecture: We have a(n) > 0  except for n = 23.
%C A227156 We also conjecture that any positive integer can be written as a sum of a triangular number and half of a term of A008407, and each integer n > 4 can be written as x + y (x>0, y>0) with x*y a term of A008407.

%e A227156 a(195) = 1 since 195 = 0^2 + A008407(23)/2.
%e A227156 a(378) = 1 since 378 = 8^2 + A008407(110)/2.

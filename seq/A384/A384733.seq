%N A384733 a(n) = 5*binomial(n,6) + 2*binomial(n,4).
%C A384733 6*a(n) is the number of words of length n defined on 5 letters that have exactly one a, exactly one b, and exactly two c's and no d's or exactly four d's and no c's (see examples).
%C A384733 3*a(n) is the number of words of length n defined on 4 letters that have exactly two a's and exactly two b's and no c's or exactly two a's and exactly four c's and no b's. For example, 3*a(6) = 3*35 = 105 since the words are the 90 permutations of aabbdd and the 15 permutations of aacccc.
%F A384733 a(n) = -(4/3)*n + (203/72)*n^2 - (33/16)*n^3 + (97/144)*n^4 - (5/48)*n^5 + (1/144)*n^6.
%F A384733 G.f.: (7*x^6 - 4*x^5 + 2*x^4)/(1-x)^7.
%F A384733 E.g.f.: exp(x)*(x^4/12 + x^6/144).
%e A384733 6*a(4) = 6*2 = 12 since the words are the 12 permutations of abcc.
%e A384733 6*a(7) = 6*105 = 630 since the words are the 420 permutations of abcceee and the 210 permutations of abdddde.

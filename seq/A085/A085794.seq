%N A085794 Lexicographically earliest squarefree infinite ternary word.
%C A085794 Open Problem 1.10.2 in the Allouche & Shallit reference asks for a good alternate characterization of this sequence. (Is it morphic, if so for which morphism?)
%C A085794 The sequence cannot be constructed in a greedy way (without backtracking) choosing each a(n) simply such that the sequence is squarefree: After (0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1) the greedy choice would be to append 0, but then one is stuck for the alphabet {0,1,2}. If the alphabet is infinite, this greedy procedure yields A007814. - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 28 2019
%C A085794 We know that an infinite ternary squarefree word exists, namely the ternary Thue-Morse sequence A036580 = A007413(.+1) - 1. The space of squarefree words is closed (limit of a sequence of squarefree words is again squarefree, using e.g. topology induced by d(x,y) = Sum_{k>=0} |x_k - y_k|/3^k or exp(-min{k: x_k != y_k})) and compact, so the inf exists and is reached for some element.

%C A085794 From _Thomas Anton_, May 01 2022: (Start)
%C A085794 A direct proof of this is as follows: as noted above we may obtain the sequence through a greedy algorithm with backtracking. This process eliminates as a prefix for any squarefree word, any word lexicographically earlier than an initial segment of this word. Since distinct words must have distinct prefixes of some length, any other squarefree word must be lexicographically later.
%C A085794 Additionally, it is not necessary to show that the inf exists since lexicographically ordered infinite words on a finite alphabet form a complete total ordering. (End)

%e A085794 From _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 29 2019: (Start)
%e A085794 After a(0) = 0 one must have a(1) = 1 because 00 is not squarefree, i.e., it has a subsequence X = 0 such that XX = 00 is also a subsequence.
%e A085794 After (0,1) one has again a(2) = 0, but then a(3) must be different from 0 (to avoid 00) and from 1 to avoid XX with X = 01, so a(3) = 2.
%e A085794 Then again a(4) = 0 and a(5) = 1.
%e A085794 Now it looks that a(6) could be equal to 0, but with this choice, there would be no possible choice for a(7): all in {0, 1, 2} would produce a square subsequence, in the last case with X = 0102. Since 1 is also excluded, a(6) = 2 is the only possible choice.
%e A085794 A partial subsequence a(0..k) is correct if one can append the infinite ternary Thue-Morse word A036580 and the result is squarefree. (Sufficient but obviously not necessary condition, consider a(k) = A036580(0).) To ensure this, one needs only to check up to twice the length of the prefixed subsequence. (End)

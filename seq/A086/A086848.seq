%N A086848 First differences are formed by interleaving {2^k - 1, k = 1, 2, 3, ...} and {11*k, k = 5, 4, 3, ...}.
%C A086848 A version of this was given as a puzzle somewhere.
%C A086848 There are infinitely many solutions to the stated sequence name producing the specified interleaving as a first difference.  I assume there was some other condition given in the puzzle that arrived at this particular solution. - _Ray Chandler_, May 07 2025

%F A086848 Empirical g.f.: x*(48*x^6+34*x^4-x^3-113*x^2+x+42) / ((x-1)^3*(x+1)^2*(2*x^2-1)). - _Colin Barker_, Mar 05 2013
%F A086848 Conjectured g.f. above confirmed.  Interleaving of two linear recurrences is another linear recurrence, as is the first difference. - _Ray Chandler_, May 07 2025

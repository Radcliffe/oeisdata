%C A237514 Let f(n) := floor( n * log(2) / log(3)), then k is in the sequence if and only if k = 1 or f(k - 1) = f(k) - 1 and f(k + 1) = f(k) + 1. - _Michael Somos_, Feb 24 2014
%C A237514 k > 1 is in the sequence if and only if the interval (k*b - b + 1, k*b + b) contains an integer, where b = log_3(2). Since b is irrational, the fractional parts of its multiples are uniformly distributed in [0,1], so the asymptotic density of this sequence is 2*b - 1 or approximately 0.26186. In particular, the sequence is infinite. Moreover, by a theorem of Vinogradov, the fractional parts of p * b for primes p are uniformly distributed in [0,1], so the subsequence of primes is infinite and has asymptotic density 2*b - 1 in the primes. - _Robert Israel_, Sep 10 2025

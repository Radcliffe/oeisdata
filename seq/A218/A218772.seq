%N A218772 Positions in the infinite trunk of beanstalk (see A179016) where the next node upwards is the smaller of the two possible branches.

%e A218772 A179016(2) = 3 is the first case where the next term A179016(3) = 4 is the smaller of two branches from 3 (the larger is 5, as 5 = 3+A000120(5)), thus the first term of this sequence is 2.
%e A218772 The next case occurs at A179016(4) = 7, as the next term here is again 8, the smaller of two branches from 7 (the larger being 9, as 9 = 7+A000120(9)), thus the second term of this sequence is 4.

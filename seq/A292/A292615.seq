%N A292615 Number of maximal cones in the prime degree p>2 superelliptic locus of the moduli space of tropical curves of genus (p-1)(n/2-1) coming from coverings with n ramification points.
%C A292615 a(n) is also the sum of the number of spanning forests over all trees with maximum vertex degree 3 with n-3 edges such that there is no vertex of degree 2 in the forest (all vertices in the forest have degree 0, 1, or 3). We can prove that this is correct.

%e A292615 For n=6, the corresponding tropical curves are given in the top row of figure 6 on page 13 of the Brandt/Helminck reference.

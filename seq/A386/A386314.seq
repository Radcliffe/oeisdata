%N A386314 a(n) is the smallest number k of the form 6*x+-1 not already in the sequence, such that 3*k+1 is already in the sequence, a(1)=1.
%C A386314 These numbers are the Collatz pre-images in the form 6*x +- 1 of all previous terms not already in the sequence.
%C A386314 The pre-images of a term t are all p which reach t by a single odd to odd step A139391(p) = t.
%C A386314 These pre-images are those p = (t*2^k-1)/3 with k>=0 which are odd integers, and with here t != 0 (mod 3) there are infinitely many p != 0 (mod 3) for each t.
%C A386314 Multiples of 3 have no odd pre-images and are excluded here in order to have the essential part of the tree of odd to odd descents.
%C A386314 The trajectory of a term t reaches 1 by steps to successively earlier terms in this sequence (at various distances apart).
%C A386314 If the Collatz Conjecture is true, then this sequence is permutation of the numbers of the form 6x +- 1 (A007310).

%e A386314 a(3) = 13, since 13 (a pre-image of a(2) = 5) is the smallest unused pre-image of a(1) and a(2).
%e A386314 a(10) = 37 since 37 (a pre-image of a(6) = 7) is the smallest unused pre-image of all previous terms.
%Y A386314 Cf. A007310, A178414, A178415, A139391.

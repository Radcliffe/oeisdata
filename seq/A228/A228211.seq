%N A228211 Decimal expansion of Legendre's constant (incorrect, the true value is 1, as in A000007).
%C A228211 Included in accordance with the OEIS policy of listing incorrect but published sequences. The correct value of this constant is 1, by the prime number theorem pi(x) ~ li(x) = x/(log(x) - 1 - 1/log(x) + O(1/log^2(x))), where li is the logarithmic integral.
%C A228211 Before the prime number theorem was proved, it was believed that there was a constant A not equal to 1 that needed to be inserted in the formula pi(n) ~ n/(log(n) - A) to make it more precise. This number was Adrien-Marie Legendre's guess.
%C A228211 Panaitopol proved that x/(log(x) - A), where A is this constant, is an upper bound for pi(x) when x > 10^6. - _John W. Nicholson_, Feb 26 2018

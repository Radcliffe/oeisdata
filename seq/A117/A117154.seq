%N A117154 Floretion with FAMP code 1teszapsumseq[C*B] with C = - .5'j + .5'k - .5j' + .5k' - 'ii' - .5'ij' - .5'ik' - .5'ji' - .5'ki' and B = - .5'i + .5'j - .5i' + .5j' - 'kk' - .5'ik' - .5'jk' - .5'ki' - .5'kj'.
%C A117154 The following parity property of this sequence seems interesting: Assume 0 is both positive and negative and let sgn(a(n)) be the sign of a(n). Then apparently sgn(a(n)) = -sgn(a(n+1)) = sgn(a(n+2)) for all n. But sgn(a(2n)) != sgn(a(2m)) for all n,m.

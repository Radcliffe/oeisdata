%N A128645 Number of groups of order A128691(n).
%C A128645 Number of groups whose order is of form 2^k*p, where 1 <= k <= 8 and p is a prime > 2.
%C A128645 The groups of these orders (up to A128691(112490698) = 2147483636 in version V2.13-4) form a class contained in the Small Groups Library of Magma.

%F A128645 a(n) = A000001(A128691(n)).
%e A128645 A128691(7) = 24 and there are 15 groups of order 24 (A000001(24) = 15), hence a(7) = 15.

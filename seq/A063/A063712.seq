%N A063712 Table of bits required for product of n- and k-bit positive numbers read by antidiagonals.
%C A063712 This sequence is A063711 without zeros.
%C A063712 The first entry is a(1,1) which (arbitrarily) is considered to have offset 1.
%C A063712 a(n, k) is also the maximal number of rooks that can be placed on an n X k chessboard so that each rook is attacked by at most (equivalently, exactly) two others. (If more than two rooks lie in a given row or column, each rook attacks only its nearest neighbors. That is, rooks don't jump.) - _Joel B. Lewis_, Oct 17 2008

%N A193948 Integers k such that for all i > k the largest prime factor of i(i+1)(i+2)(i+3)(i+4)(i+5)(i+6) exceeds the largest prime factor of k(k+1)(k+2)(k+3)(k+4)(k+5)(k+6).
%C A193948 Currently terms through a(16) = 12874 have been proved to be correct, while remaining terms are conjectural. Stormer's theorem (see link) provides an approach to proving their correctness. Such an approach should be easy for the first few terms. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Nov 07 2011

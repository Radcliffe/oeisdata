%N A371886 The number of multiples (k) of n where the interval contained in an equal temperament with k*n divisions of the octave (k*n-ET) that best approximates the just perfect fifth (3:2) is equal to that of an equal temperament with n divisions.
%C A371886 "Best" is by minimum absolute difference, so the best approximation for n divisions is the rational r = f/n where f = A366701(n), or the size of the perfect fifth in n-ET divisions which minimizes d = abs(r - L) where L = log_2(3/2).
%C A371886 a(n) = k is the largest k for which A366701(k*n) = k * A366701(n); i.e., subdividing each step in n-ET by k has not offered a better approximation than r.
%C A371886 This k is the largest k for which 1/(k*n) > 2*d, since a step to f +- 1/(k*n) is not in the range (L-d, L+d) and therefore is not closer to L.

%F A371886 a(n) = floor(1 / (2 * abs(round(n*log_2(3/2)) - n*log_2(3/2)))).
%e A371886 For n = 12, the nearest integer to 12*log_2(3/2) is 7, yielding r = 7/12. Because r is equal for all multiples of 12 (24 yields 14/24, 36 yields 21/36, etc.) through 12*25=300 (175/300), so a(12) = 25. The best approximation for 12*26=312 is 183/312, which is not equal to 7/12, so 300 is in fact the highest multiple.

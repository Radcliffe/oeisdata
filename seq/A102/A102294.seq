%N A102294 Number of prime divisors (with multiplicity) of icosahedral numbers.
%C A102294 Because the cubic factors into n time a quadratic, the icosahedral numbers can never be prime, but can be semiprime (only if n is prime and also n*(5*n^2 - 5*n + 2)/2 is prime, as with n = 31, 61, ...

%F A102294 a(n) = A001222(A006564(n)) = Bigomega(n*(5*n^2 - 5*n + 2)/2).
%e A102294 IcosahedralNumber(13) = 5083 = 13 * 17 * 23 so Omega(IcosahedralNumber(13)) = 3.
%e A102294 IcosahedralNumber(37) = 123247 = 37 * 3331 so Omega(IcosahedralNumber(37)) = 2, hence the 37th icosahedral number is the smallest to be semiprime.

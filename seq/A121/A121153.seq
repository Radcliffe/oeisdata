%N A121153 Numbers k with the property that 1/k can be written in base 3 in such a way that the fractional part contains no 1's.
%C A121153 Numbers k such that 1/k is in the Cantor set.
%C A121153 A subsequence of A054591. The first member of A054591 which does not belong to this sequence is 146. See A135666.
%C A121153 This is not a subsequence of A005836 (949 belongs to the present sequence but not to A005836). See A170830, A170853.

%e A121153 1/3 in base 3 can be written as either .1 or .0222222... The latter version contains no 1's, so 3 is in the sequence.
%e A121153 1/4 in base 3 is .02020202020..., so 4 is in the sequence.

%N A368538 Integers k such that there exists a group of order k with exactly k subgroups.
%C A368538 Powers of 4 cannot appear in this sequence. This is because for a group of order p^n, the number of subgroups of order p^k is congruent to 1 mod p, for 0 <= k <= n. It follows from p=2 and Lagrange's theorem that the number of subgroups of order 2^n for n even is congruent to 1 mod 2, i.e. not equal to 2^n. - _Robin Jones_, Feb 17 2024
%C A368538 a(34) >= 512. The smallest term strictly larger than 512 is 560. - _Robin Jones_, Feb 18 2024
%H A368538 Richard Stanley, <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/495845">What finite groups have as many elements as subgroups?</a> Question in MathOverflow, answered by Dave Benson and others, Jun 07 2025.
%e A368538 1 is a term since the trivial group (order 1) has exactly 1 subgroup.
%e A368538 2 is a term since the cyclic group C_2 has exactly 2 subgroups.
%e A368538 6 is a term since the symmetric group S_3 has exactly 6 subgroups.

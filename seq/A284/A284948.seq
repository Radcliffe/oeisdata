%N A284948 1-limiting word of the morphism 0 -> 10, 1 -> 00.
%C A284948 Consider iterations of the morphism defined by 0 -> 10, 1 -> 00: 0 -> 10 -> 0010 -> 10100010 -> 0010001010100010 -> ...  There are two limiting words, one of which has initial term 1 and the other, 0. These are fixed points of the morphism squared: 0-> 0010, 1->1010. [Corrected by _Michel Dekking_, Jan 06 2019]
%C A284948 The 0-limiting word is 0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,... (A328979). It is the characteristic sequence of those natural numbers whose binary representation ends in an odd numbers of zeros, sequence A036554, but with offset 0 (easy to see from the fact that if the binary representation of N is equal to w, then the binary representations of 4N, 4N+1, 4N+2 and 4N+3 are w00, w01, w10 and w11). - _Michel Dekking_, Jan 06 2019

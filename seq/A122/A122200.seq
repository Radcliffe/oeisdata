%N A122200 Signature permutations of RIBS-transformations of non-recursive Catalan automorphisms in table A089840.
%C A122200 Row n is the signature permutation of the Catalan automorphism which is obtained from the n-th nonrecursive automorphism in the table A089840 with the recursion scheme "RIBS".
%C A122200 In this recursion scheme the given automorphism is applied to all (toplevel) subtrees of the Catalan structure, when it is interpreted as a general tree. Permutations in this table form a countable group, which is isomorphic with the group in A089840. (The RIBS transformation gives the group isomorphism.)
%C A122200 Furthermore, row n of this table is also found as the row A123694(n) in tables A122203 and A122204. If the count of fixed points of the automorphism A089840[n] is given by sequence f, then the count of fixed points of the automorphism A089840[A123694(n)] is given by CONV(f,A000108) (where CONV stands for convolution) and the count of fixed points of the automorphism A122200[n] by INVERT(RIGHT(f)).
%C A122200 The associated Scheme-procedures RIBS and !RIBS can be used to obtain such a transformed automorphism from any constructively or destructively implemented automorphism.
%C A122200 This sequence agrees with A025581 in its initial terms, but then diverges from it. - _Antti Karttunen_, May 11 2008

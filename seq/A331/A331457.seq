%N A331457 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) = number of regions in a "frame" of size n X k (see Comments for definition).
%C A331457 A "frame" of size n X k is formed from a grid of (n+1) X (k+1) points with the central grid of (n-3) X (k-3) points removed. If n or k is less than 3 then no points are removed, and T(n,k) = A331452(n,k). From now on we assume both n and k are >= 3.
%C A331457 The resulting array has an outer perimeter with 2*(n+k) points and an inner perimeter with 2*(n+k)-8 points, for a total of 4*(n+k)-8 perimeter points. The frame itself is the strip of width 1 between the inner and outer perimeters.
%C A331457 Now join every pair of perimeter points, both inner and outer, by a line segment, provided the line remains inside the frame. The sequence gives the number of regions in the resulting figure.
%C A331457 See A331776 for additional illustrations for the diagonal entries.
%C A331457 There is a crucial difference between frames of size nX2 and size nXk with k = 1 or k >= 3. If k != 2, all regions are either triangles or quadrilaterals, but for k=2 regions with larger numbers of sides can appear. Remember also that for k <= 2, the "frame" has no hole, and the graph has genus 0, whereas for k >= 3 there is a nontrivial hole and the graph has genus 1.

%N A235487 Self-inverse and multiplicative permutation of integers: For n < 7, a(n)=n, a(7)=8 and a(8)=7, a(p_i) = p_{a(i)} for primes with index i <> 4, and for composites > 8, a(u*v) = a(u) * a(v).
%C A235487 The permutation satisfies A000040(a(n)) = a(A000040(n)) for all positive n except n=4, and is self-inverse. It swaps 7 & 8, maps any prime p_i with index i > 4 to p_{a(i)}, and lets the multiplicativity take care of the rest.
%C A235487 This can be viewed also as a "signature-permutation" for a bijection on non-oriented rooted trees, mapped through the Matula-Goebel numbers (cf. A061773). This bijection will swap the subtrees encoded by numbers 7 and 8, wherever they occur as the terminal configurations anywhere in the tree:
%C A235487 .......................
%C A235487 .o...o.................
%C A235487 ..\./..................
%C A235487 ...o.............o.o.o.
%C A235487 ...|..............\|/..
%C A235487 ...x.....<--->.....x...
%C A235487 ...7...............8...
%C A235487 Thus any branch of the tree that ends with three edges in Y-formation, will be transformed so that those three edges will emanate "in parallel" from the same vertex. Vice versa, any terminal configuration in the tree that consists of more than two single edges next to each other (in "parallel") will be transformed so that maximal 3k number of those single edges will be transformed to k Y-formations, and one or two left-over edges, if present, will stay as they are.

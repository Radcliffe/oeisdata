%N A165885 Minimum sum of a set of positive integers such that every positive integer <= n is the sum of 1 or 2 elements of the set.
%C A165885 If it is possible to make every value from 1 to n using at most 2 of the coins used in a country, what is the minimum possible value of the sum of the coins in this country?
%C A165885 By considering sets {1, 2, ..., r, 2r, 3r, ..., (s-1)r}, it is conjectured that the asymptotic behavior is a(n) ~ 3/4 * 2^(1/3) * n^(4/3).
%C A165885 From _Martin Fuller_, Jul 26 2025: (Start)
%C A165885 A slightly better upper bound can be obtained from the following set: {1, 2, ..., r-1; n+1-r*(s-1), n+1-r*(s-2), ..., n+1-r} where r*s <= n+1 < r*(s+1). If n+1-r*s <= r/2-1 then n+1-r*s can be removed from the set.
%C A165885 There is an optimal set of this form for 54 of the first 100 terms of the sequence. (End)

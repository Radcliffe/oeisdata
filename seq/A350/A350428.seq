%N A350428 2*a(n)/n! is the average number of key comparisons required to sort n records with distinct keys using heapsort (Algorithm H in Don Knuth's TAOCP Vol. 3).
%C A350428 There are two places in the algorithm where the keys are compared. The first is in step H4 [Find larger child.] and the second in step H6 [Larger than K?]. The sequence is the sum, divided by 2, of the counts of these comparisons, taken over all n! possible orders of the records.

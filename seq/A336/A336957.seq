%N A336957 The Enots Wolley sequence: the lexicographically earliest infinite sequence {a(n)} of distinct positive numbers such that, for n>2, a(n) has a common factor with a(n-1) but not with a(n-2).
%C A336957 Suggested by the Yellowstone permutation A098550 except that now the key conditions in the definition have been reversed.
%C A336957 Let Ker(k), the kernel of k, denote the set of primes dividing k. Thus Ker(36) = {2,3}, Ker(1) = {}. Then Product_{p in Ker(k)} p = A000265(k), which is denoted by ker(k).
%C A336957 Theorem 1: For n>2, a(n) is the smallest number m not yet in the sequence such that
%C A336957 (i) Ker(m) intersect Ker(a(n-1)) is nonempty,
%C A336957 (ii) Ker(m) intersect Ker(a(n-2)) is empty, and
%C A336957 (iii) The set Ker(m) \ Ker(a(n-1)) is nonempty.
%C A336957 (Without condition (iii), every prime dividing m might also divide a(n-1), which would make it impossible to find a(n+1).)
%C A336957 Idea of proof: m always exists and is unique; no smaller choice for a(n) is possible; and taking a(n)=m does not lead to a contradiction. So a(n) must be m.
%C A336957 Theorem 2: For n>2, Ker(a(n)) contains at least two primes. (Immediate from Theorem 1, since a(n) must contain a prime in a(n-1) and a prime not in a(n-1).)
%C A336957 It follows that no odd prime p or even-or-odd prime power q^k, k>1, appears in the sequence. Obviously this sequence is not a permutation of the positive integers.
%C A336957 Theorem 3. For any M there is an n_0 such that n > n_0 implies a(n) > M. (This is a standard property of any sequence of distinct positive terms - see the Yellowstone paper).
%C A336957 Theorem 4. For any prime p, some term is divisible by p.
%C A336957 Proof. Take p=17 for concreteness. If 17 does not divide any term, then 19 cannot either (because the first time 19 appears, we could have used 17 instead).
%C A336957 So all terms are products only of 2,3,5,7,11,13. Go out a long way, use Theorem 2, and consider two huge successive terms, A*B, C*D, where Ker(B) = Ker(C) and Ker(A) intersect Ker(D) is empty. Either C or D must contain a huge prime power q^k, 2 <= q <= 13. If it is in C, replace it by q and multiply D by 17. If it is in D, replace it by 17. Either way we get a smaller legal candidate for C*D that is a multiple of 17. QED
%C A336957 Theorem 5. There are infinitely many even terms.
%C A336957 Proof. Suppose the prime p appears for the first times as a factor of a(n). Then we have a(n-1) = x*q^i, a(n) = q*p, where q<p is a prime and i >= 1. If q=2 then a(n) is even. So we may suppose q is odd. If x is odd then a(n+1) = 2*p. If x is even then obviously a(n-1) is even. So one of a(n-1), a(n), or a(n+1) is even for every prime p. So there are infinitely many even terms. QED - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Aug 28 2020
%C A336957 Theorem 6: For any prime p, infinitely many terms are divisible by p. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Sep 09 2020. (I thought I had a proof that for any odd prime p, there is a term equal to 2p, but there was a gap in the argument. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Sep 23 2020)
%C A336957 Theorem 7: There are infinitely many odd terms. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Sep 12 2020
%C A336957 Conjecture 1: Every number with at least two distinct prime factors is in the sequence. In other words, apart from 1 and 2, this sequence is the complement of A000961.
%C A336957 [It seems very likely that the arguments used to prove Theorem 1 of the Yellowstone Permutation paper can be modified to prove the conjecture.]
%C A336957 The conditions permit us to start with a(1)=1, a(2)=2, and that does not lead to a contradiction, so those are the first two terms.
%C A336957 After 1, 2, the next term cannot be 4 or 5, but a(3) = 6 works.
%C A336957 For a(4), we can rule out 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 11, 13 (powers of primes), and 10, 12, and 14 have a common factor with a(2). So a(4) = 15.
%C A336957 The graph of the first 100000 terms (see link) is similar to that of the Yellowstone permutation, but here the points lie on more lines.
%C A336957 The sequence has fixed points at n = 1, 2, 10, 90, 106, 150, 162, 246, 394, 398, 406, 410, ... (see A338050). - _Scott R. Shannon_, Aug 13 2020
%C A336957 The initial pattern of odd and even terms: (odd, even, even, odd), repeat, is misleading as it does not persist. (See A337644 for more about this point.)
%C A336957 Discussion of when primes first divide some term, from _N. J. A. Sloane_, Oct 21 2020: (Start)
%C A336957 When an odd prime p first divides a term of the Enots Wolley sequence (the present sequence), that term a(n) is equal to q*p where q<p is also a prime. We say that p is introduced by q. It appears q is almost always 2 (the corresponding values of p form A337648), that there are precisely 34 instances when q = 3 (see A337649), and q>3 happens just once, at a(5) = 35 when q=5 and p=7.
%C A336957 We conjecture that even if p is introduced by some prime q>2, 2*p appears later.
%C A336957 Sequence A337275 lists the index k such that a(k) = 2*prime(n), or -1 if 2*prime(n) is missing, and A338074 lists the indices k such that a(k) is twice a prime.
%C A336957 Comparison of those two sequences shows that they appear to be essentially identical (see the table in A337275).
%C A336957 The differences between the two sequences are caused by the fact that although normally if p and q are odd primes with p < q, then 2p precedes 2q, this is not true for the following primes: (7,5), (31,29), and (109, 113, 107), which appear in the order shown. We conjecture that these are the only exceptions.
%C A336957 Combining the above observations, we conjecture that for n >= 755 (at which point we have seen all the primes <= 367), every prime p is introduced by 2*p, and the terms 2*p appear in their natural order.

%N A103320 Condensed Golomb sequence: digits according to Golomb's sequence, same digits concatenated.
%C A103320 a(4) = 444 because Golomb's sequence has three terms a(n)=4. As the sequence handles with digits, next term a(10)=1010101010 adds 5 digits "1", which is excluded because < a(1)=1 > states there is only one digit "1". Therefore a(10) and next terms are impossible and the sequence is finite.

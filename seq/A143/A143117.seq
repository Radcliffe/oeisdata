%N A143117 a(n) = the smallest positive integer that divides no more than one integer k, where n-th prime <= k <= (n+1)th prime.
%F A143117 a(n) = A140715(n) + 1.
%e A143117 The 16th prime is 53 and the 17th prime is 59. So we will concern ourselves with the integers 53,54,55,56,57,58,59. 1 divides all these integers. 2 divides three of these integers (54,56,58). 3 divides 54 and 57. 4 divides just 56. So a(16) = 4.

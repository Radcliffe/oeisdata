%N A103291 Numbers k such that sigma(2^k-1) >= 2*(2^k-1)-1, i.e., the number 2^k-1 is perfect, abundant, or least deficient.
%C A103291 Is there an odd term besides 1? Numbers 2^a(i)-1 form set difference of sequences A103289 and A096399.
%C A103291 Odd terms > 1 exist, but there are none < 10^7. If k > 1 is an odd term, then 2^k-1 must have more than 900000 distinct prime factors and all of them must be members of A014663. - _David Wasserman_, Apr 15 2008

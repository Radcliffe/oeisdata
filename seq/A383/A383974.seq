%N A383974 Number of connected subsets of n edges of the icosahedron up to the 120 rotations and reflections of the icosahedron.
%C A383974 Connected subsets of edges are also called "polysticks," "polyedges," and "polyforms."
%C A383974 These are "free" polyforms, in that two polyforms are equivalent if one can be mapped to the other using the 120 symmetries of the icosahedron.

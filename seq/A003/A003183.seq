%N A003183 Number of NPN-equivalence classes of unate Boolean functions of n or fewer variables.
%C A003183 Number of inequivalent (under the group of permutations and "inversion of variables") monotone Boolean functions of n of fewer variables.
%C A003183 Given f, a function of n variables, we define the "inversion of variables", i, by (i.f)(x1,...,xn)=1+f(1+x1,...,1+xn) (we can write (i.f)(x)=1+f(1+x) where the second "1" denotes (1,...,1)). It turns out that if f is monotone, then i.f is also monotone. On the other hand, a permutation of n elements, p, acts on f by (p.f)(x)=f(p(x)). It turns out that if f is monotone, then p.f is also monotone. We define p.i by (p.i)(f)=p.(i.f) and i.p by (i.p)(f)=i.(p.f). If we define a.b by (a.b).f=a.(b.f) for a,b elements of G, it turns out that G={p.i,p: p is a permutation of n elements} is a group. In this context, f and g are equivalent if there exists b (an element of G) such that b.f=g.

%e A003183 a(2)=3 because m(x,y)=x, n(x,y)=y, k(x,y)=0, h(x,y)=1, f(x,y)=x*y, g(x,y)=x+y+xy are the six monotone Boolean functions of 2 or fewer variables; m and n are equivalent, k and h are equivalent, f and g are equivalent. Then we have 3 inequivalent monotone Boolean functions of 2 or fewer variables.

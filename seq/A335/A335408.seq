%N A335408 Diameter of nearest neighbor interchange distance for free 3-trees.
%C A335408 a(n) is the maximum value of the nearest neighbor interchange distance between two unrooted binary trees with n leaves, obtained by evaluating the distance from one tree with each of the unlabeled n-leaf tree shapes (see A000672) to each labeled n-leaf tree (A001147) using the C script described in Li et al. (1996).
%C A335408 The known terms a(3),...,a(12) happen (coincidentally?) to match the first ten terms of A211266. However, it seems unlikely that the sequences will agree for ever.

%Y A335408 Cf. A211266, which happens to have the same initial terms (offset by two).  It is not clear whether this correspondence continues for higher terms.
%Y A335408 A000672 gives the number of unrooted tree shapes on n leaves; A001147 gives the number of (labeled) unrooted trees.

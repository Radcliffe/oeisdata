%N A206478 (Number of permutations of {1,2,...,n} for which sums of four consecutive numbers (with wraparound) are all distinct)/2n.
%C A206478 Essentially different ways that 1,2,...,n can be placed around a circle so that the sums of three consecutive terms are all distinct.
%e A206478 a(6)=8 because up to rotation/reflection the only three permutations which work are 123465, 123546, 124653, 125364, 126543, 132456, 132645, 136524.

%N A319520 Starts of strictly increasing runs of 0's in Mertens's function A002321.
%C A319520 a(n) is always squarefree.
%C A319520 It is not known whether this sequence is infinite. Sequence A045882 is infinite but it appears that increasing runs of consecutive nonsquarefree numbers thin out very quickly. The requirement that the runs consist of 0's is much stronger and makes it uncertain whether this sequence is also infinite.
%e A319520 2 is a term because M(2) = 0.
%e A319520 39 is a term because M(39) = M(40) = 0.
%e A319520 331 is a term because M(331) = M(332) = M(333) = 0.
%e A319520 422 is a term because M(422) = ... = M(425) = 0.
%e A319520 45371 is a term because M(45371) = ... = M(45376) = 0.

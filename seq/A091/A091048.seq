%N A091048 a(n) = the number of steps needed to reach the final value of n via repeated interpretation of n as a base b+1 number where b is the largest digit of n.
%C A091048 Any value of n with at least one digit 9 will not reduce further since 9+1 is 10 and n in base 10 is n. Also any single-digit number will likewise not reduce further. Such values of n therefore require 0 steps to reduce. Many terms reduce in very few steps and others take longer (88 for example, takes 8 steps). There is no maximum number of steps. See A091049 to see the first term requiring n steps. See A091047 to see the actual unchanging value reached for each value of n.

%e A091048 a(18)=4 because (1) 18 in base 9 is 17. (2) 17 in base 8 is 15. (3) 15 in base 6 is 11. (4) 11 in base 2 is 3. 3 does not reduce further because 3 in base 4 is 3. Thus 18 reduces to 3 in 4 steps.

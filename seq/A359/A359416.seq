%N A359416 Write n as 2^m - k, where 2^m is the least power of 2 >= n (0 <= k <= 2^(m-1)-1). For n a power of 2 (k = 0), a(n) = n. For numbers with k > 0, a(n) is the least p*a(k) which has not occurred previously, the count of k being taken from right to left (backwards) from k = 1 at 2^m - 1.
%C A359416 A variant of the recursive definition of the Doudna sequence A005940, and A356886. Whereas a sequence is normally computed in natural order (A000027) of its indices (a(1), a(2), a(3), etc.), in this case terms with indices n other than powers of 2 are computed backwards, right to left from the least power of 2 exceeding n (ordering as in A122155). For example, with terms between a(4) and a(8) the order of computation is a(7), then a(6), then a(5), each time choosing a least novel number matching the definition, see Example. Compare with similar sequence A356886, where a similar definition is used but the count is conventional: left to right.
%C A359416 Conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers in which primes appear in natural order. The even bisection, when divided by 2, reproduces the sequence.

%F A359416 a(2*n)/2 = a(n); n >= 1.

%F A359416 a(2^n + 1) = prime(n)^2; n >= 2.
%F A359416 At the occurrence of 2^n (n >= 3) the following pattern of five successive terms is observed: 3*prime(n-1), 2*prime(n-1), prime(n), 2^n, prime(n)^2, ....
%F A359416 For n >= 2, a(2^n + 1)/a(2^n - 1) = prime(n); compare with A357057).
%e A359416 a(3) = 3 because 3 = 2^2 - 1, so k = 1 and 3 is the least odd prime multiple of a(1).
%e A359416 a(7) = 5 because 7 = 2^3 - 1, k = 1, a(1) = 1 and 5 is the least multiple of 1 not seen already. (At this point a(5), a(6) have not been found.)
%e A359416 a(6) = 6 since k = 2, a(2) = 2, and 3*2 is the least number not seen already.
%e A359416 a(5) = 9 since k = 3, a(3) = 3, so we choose 3*3.

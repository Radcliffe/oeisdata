%N A376511 a(1) = 2. For n > 1, if a(n-1) is a novel term, a(n)=A001414(a(n-1)), else if there are k (>1) occurrences of a(j) = a(n-1) (1<=j<=n-1), a(n) is the smallest novel m such that A001414(m) = k*a(n-1).
%C A376511 Sequence inspired by a revisit to A353125. a(n) is a novel prime p iff a(n-1) is a term in A046363, following which a(n+1) is also = p. The first occurrences of 4 or p are followed by 4 or p respectively (4 being the only composite m such that Sopfr(m)=m), and these are the only terms repeated contiguously in this sequence. 3 cannot be a term because it is not given, and there is no composite g such that Sopfr(g)=3. A string of descending composite terms follows primes p,p until reaching (i) a repeat of an earlier term, or (ii) a term in A046363 (which produces a new prime pair q,q). If (i) the sequence resets immediately to a new string of descending composite terms, and if (ii) the reset occurs after the next pair q,q of primes. Every positive integer m (other than 3) occurs a maximum of A000607(m) times, this being the number of numbers k such that Sopfr(k)=m.
%C A376511 Row n of table T(n,k) in A064364 lists numbers j such that A001414(j) = n, with T(n,1) = A056240(n), and every term in this sequence is taken from the appropriate row of A064364. When a(n-1) is a novel term a(n) = A001414(a(n-1)), which is defined. Otherwise a(n) = smallest m such that A001414(m) = k*a(n-1), a number which is also defined since it is the smallest unused term in T(k*a(n-1),k) of A064364. Therefore the sequence is well defined and infinite. Conjecture: For any n > 1 every term in T(n,k) of A064364 appears eventually.

Primes first appear in pairs.
%F A376511 If a(k) = first occasion of prime p, a(k+1) = p, a(k+2) = A056240(2*p), a(k+3) = 2*p.
%e A376511 a(1) = 2 is given, then since 2 is a novel term, a(2) = A001414(2) = 2. 2 has now been seen k = 2 times so a(3) is the smallest novel m such that A001414(m) = 2*2 = 4, so a(3) = 4, a novel term meaning that a(4) = A001414(4) = 4. now 4 has been seen twice so a(5) is the smallest novel m such that A001414(m) = 2*4 = 8, so a(5) = 15.

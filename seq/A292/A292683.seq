%N A292683 Numbers divisible by themselves with first digit removed (A217657), excluding multiples of 10.
%C A292683 Obviously, any term multiplied by 10 would again be a term, so we exclude trailing zeros.
%C A292683 This sequence cannot contain single-digit numbers (which would yield 0 with the initial digit removed), in contrast to A178158 (numbers divisible by every suffix of n) where the condition is vacuously satisfied for single-digit numbers.
%C A292683 416 is the first term in the present sequence which is not in A178158.
%C A292683 See A292684 and A292685 for the (number of) multiples of N = a(n) which have the same property and yield the same ratio N/A217657(N).

%e A292683 12 is in the sequence because it is divisible by 2.
%e A292683 416 is in the sequence because it is divisible by 16, 416 = 4*4*25 + 16.

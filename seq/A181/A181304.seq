%N A181304 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of 2-compositions of n having k columns with increasing entries (0<=k<=n).
%C A181304 Also, triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of 2-compositions of n having k odd entries in the top row. A 2-composition of n is a nonnegative matrix with two rows, such that each column has at least one nonzero entry and whose entries sum up to n.
%C A181304 A 2-composition of n is a nonnegative matrix with two rows, such that each column has at least one nonzero entry and whose entries sum up to n.
%C A181304 The sum of entries in row n is A003480(n).
%C A181304 For the statistic "number of even entries in the top row" see A181336.

%F A181304 T(n,0) = A181306(n).
%F A181304 Sum_{k>=0} k*T(n,k) = A181305(n).
%F A181304 G.f.: G(t,z) = (1+z)*(1-z)^2/(1-(2+t)*z-2*z^2+2*z^3).
%F A181304 G.f. for column k: z^k*(1+z)*(1-z)^2/(1-2*z-2*z^2+2*z^3)^(k+1) (we have a Riordan array).
%F A181304 The g.f. H=H(t,s,z), where z marks size and t (s) marks odd (even) entries in the top row, is given by H = (1+z)(1-z)^2/[(1+z)(1-z)^2-(t+s)z-sz^2*(1-z)].
%e A181304 T(2,1) = 3 because we have (0/2), (1,0/0,1), and (0,1/1,0) (the 2-compositions are written as (top row / bottom row)).
%e A181304 Alternatively, T(2,1) = 3 because we have (1/1), (1,0/0,1), and (0,1/1,0) (the 2-compositions are written as (top row / bottom row)).

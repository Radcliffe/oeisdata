%N A218773 Positions in the infinite trunk of beanstalk (see A179016) where the next node upwards is the larger of the two possible branches.

%e A218773 A179016(0) = 0 is the first case where the next term A179016(2) = 1 is the larger of two branches from 0 (the smaller branch in this case being 0 itself, as 0 = 0+A000120(0)), thus the first term of this sequence is 0.
%e A218773 A179016(1) = 1 is the second case where the next term A179016(3) = 3 is the larger of two branches from 1 (the smaller branch in this case being 2, as 2 = 1+A000120(2), 2 being a leaf node, one of the terms of A055938), thus the second term of this sequence is 1.

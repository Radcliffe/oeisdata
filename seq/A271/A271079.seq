%N A271079 Residues (mod 32) of partial sums of Fibonacci numbers starting with F(2).
%C A271079 If one Pisano period (of 48 members) is partitioned sequentially as 8 groups of 6, then we observe that in each group, the 6th member is 0.
%C A271079 There are 8 instances of this residue 0.
%C A271079 The set of residues {3,7,11,15,19,23,27,31} is seen in the 2nd members of each group of 6, and similarly seen in the 4th, and in the 5th members. This set appears in a total of 3 instances.
%C A271079 The set of residues {6,14,22,30} has 2 instances, seen when considering the 3rd members of each group of 6.
%C A271079 The set of residues {1,5,9,13,17,21,25,29} appears as 1 instance when considering the 1st members of each group of 6.
%C A271079 For the 8 instances case, each residue is congruent to 8 (mod 4).
%C A271079 For the 3 instances case, each residue is congruent to 3 (mod 4).
%C A271079 For the 2 instances case, each residue is congruent to 2 (mod 4).
%C A271079 For the 1 instances case, each residue is congruent to 1 (mod 4).
%C A271079 8,3,2,1 are Fibonacci numbers.

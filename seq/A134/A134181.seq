%N A134181 Difference between cumulative prime and odd sums.
%C A134181 This sequence is the difference between A071148 and A005563, as seen in the following tabular example: first column is prime, 2nd is odd, 3rd is prime sum (A071148), 4th is odd sum (A005563), 5th is the difference at each summation, the prime sequence increasingly greater.

%F A134181 Beginning with 3 for both the prime and odd sequences, compute cumulative sums of both sequences and take the difference
%e A134181 a(2)=0 because for the prime sequence beginning at 3, the sum is 8 (3+5). For the odd sequence beginning at 3 the sum is also 8 (3+5) and 8-8=0.

%N A334652 Number of integer partitions of n with at least two parts, each greater than 1 and with the same multiplicity.
%C A334652 All parts are greater than 1, there are at least two parts, and each part size has the same multiplicity.
%C A334652 This sequence was inspired by a post of Ali Sada, May 07 2020 on the seqfan mailing list.

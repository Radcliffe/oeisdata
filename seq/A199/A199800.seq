%N A199800 Number of ways to write n = p+q with p, 6q-1 and 6q+1 all prime.
%C A199800 Conjecture: a(n)>0 for all n>11.
%C A199800 This implies the twin prime conjecture, and it has been verified for n up to 10^9.
%C A199800 Zhi-Wei Sun also made some similar conjectures, for example, any integer n>5 can be written as p+q with p, 2q-3 and 2q+3 all prime, and each integer n>4 can be written as p+q with p, 3q-2+(n mod 2) and 3q+2-(n mod 2) all prime.

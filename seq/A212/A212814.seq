%C A212814 Comment from Hans Havermann, Sequence Fans Mailing List, May 31 2012: The 11 numbers k for which A212813(k)=2 are 9, 11, 14, 20, 24, 27, 28, 40, 45, 48, 54. Empirically, it appears that 2632 is the sum of the number of prime partitions (A000607) of the eleven numbers 8, 10, 13, 19, 23, 26, 27, 39, 44, 47, 53. I hesitate turning this into a conjecture only because the 3 numbers k for which A212813(k)=1 are 7, 10, 12 and the sum of the number of prime partitions of the three numbers 6, 9, 11 is twelve, not eleven (the extra partition being, I think, 2+2+2).

%N A050296 Maximum cardinality of a strongly triple-free subset of {1, 2, ..., n}.
%C A050296 Computed using the following integer programming formulation, where the decision variable x[i] is 1 if i is a member of the strongly triple-free subset, 0 otherwise. Maximize sum {i in 1..n} x[i] subject to x[i] + x[3i] <= 1 for i in 1..n such that 3i in 1..n, x[i] + x[2i] <= 1 for i in 1..n such that 2i in 1..n, x[i] in {0,1} for i in 1..n. - _Rob Pratt_, Oct 25 2002
%C A050296 The problem can also be thought of as finding a maximum independent set in a graph with nodes 1..n and edges of the form (i,3i) and (i,2i). - _Rob Pratt_, Oct 25 2002

%N A283297 The smallest cardinality of a difference-basis in the cyclic group of order n.
%C A283297 A subset B is called a difference-basis for an Abelian group G if B-B=G. This sequence is calculated by computer. For n=1+q+q*q where q is a power of a prime number the smallest cardinality of a difference-basis equals q+1, which is witnessed by the difference set of Singer. The problem of calculating the values of the sequence seems to be of exponential complexity.

%F A283297 a(n) = q+1 if n=1+q+q*q for q a power of a prime number.
%F A283297 a(n) >= (1+sqrt(4n-3))/2;

%F A283297 a(n) < sqrt(2n) if n>=5 and sqrt(n/8) is not integer.
%F A283297 It is an open problem whether a(n) = (1+o(1))*sqrt(n). See the MathOverflow link.
%e A283297 From _Ed Pegg Jr_, Jul 17 2025: (Start)
%e A283297 For a(n), n is the modulus for differences in Z_n. The difference basis here is what Singer called a difference set, also called a circular sparse ruler.
%e A283297 For a(21), basis (0, 1, 4, 14, 16) corresponds to (1, 3, 10, 2, 5), a Singer "perfect partition".
%e A283297 For a(28), (1, 3, 11, 5, 2, 6) is a unique non-perfect cyclic partition for the basis.
%e A283297 For a(95), (1, 2, 6, 11, 13, 14, 8, 15, 16, 5, 4) is one of ten partitions. (End)

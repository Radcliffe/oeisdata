%N A182888 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of weighted lattice paths in L_n having k (1,0)-steps at level 0. These are paths of weight n that start at (0,0) , end on the horizontal axis and whose steps are of the following four kinds: an (1,0)-step with weight 1, an (1,0)-step with weight 2, a (1,1)-step with weight 2, and a (1,-1)-step with weight 1. The weight of a path is the sum of the weights of its steps.

%e A182888 T(3,1)=2. Indeed, denoting by h (H) the (1,0)-step of weight 1 (2), and u=(1,1), d=(1,-1), the five paths of weight 3 are ud, du, hH, Hh, and hhh; two of them, namely hH and Hh, have exactly two (1,0)-steps at level 0.

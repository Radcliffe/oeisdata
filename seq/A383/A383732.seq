%N A383732 a(n) is the smallest k such that every digit from 0 to 9 appears at least n times among the first k digits of Pi (after the decimal point).
%C A383732 The first 6 terms also appear in A037008, the position of the digit 0 in the decimal expansion of Pi.
%C A383732 From _Pontus von BrÃ¶mssen_, May 13 2025: (Start)
%C A383732 If the digit "3" before the decimal point is included (but a(n) still represents the number of digits after the decimal point), the first difference to this sequence (i.e., the first time the extra "3" is useful) would be a(229) = 2583 instead of 2597.
%C A383732 For d = 0, 1, ..., 9, the smallest n >= 1 for which d is the last digit to occur n times is 1, 146359, 2100, 229, 94, 61, 118, 7, 794, 9734, respectively.

%e A383732 For n = 1, a(1) = 32 since this is the first position in the decimal expansion of Pi such that every digit from 0 to 9 has appeared at least once among the first 32 digits.
%e A383732 For n = 2, a(2) = 50 since this is the first position in the decimal expansion of Pi such that every digit from 0 to 9 has appeared at least twice among the first 50 digits.

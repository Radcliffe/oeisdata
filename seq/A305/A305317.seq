%N A305317 a(n) gives the length of the period of the regular continued fraction of the quadratic irrational of any Markoff form representative Mf(n), n >= 1 (assuming the uniqueness conjecture).
%C A305317 The index n enumerates the Markoff triples with largest member m from A002559 in increasing order. If the Markoff-Frobenius uniqueness conjecture (see, e.g. the book of Aigner) is true then the triples can be numbered by n if the largest member is m(n) = A002559(n). In the other (unlikely) case there may be more than one triple (hence forms) for some Markoff numbers m from A002559, and then one orders these triples lexicographically.
%C A305317 The indefinite binary quadratic Markoff form Mf(n) = Mf(n;x,y) for the given Markoff number m(n) = A002559(n), n >= 1, (assuming that the mentioned uniqueness conjecture is true) is m(n)*x^2 + (3*m(n) - 2*k(n))*x*y + (l(n) - 3*k(n))y^2 with l(n) = (k(n)^2 +1)/m(n), and k(n) is defined for the representative form (of the unimodualar equvivalence class), e.g., in Cassels as k(n) = k_C(n) = A305310(n). The qudadratic irrational xi(n) is the solution of Mf(n;x,1) = 0 with the positive root. For the representative forms used by Cassels the regular continued fractions for xi(n) = xi_C(n) are not purely periodic. The smallest preperiod is -1 for n = 1 and 0 for n >= 2.
%C A305317 For the representative Mf(n) with k(n) = A305311(n) = k_C(n) + 2*m(n) one obtains purely periodic regular continued fractions for the quadratic irrationals xi(n). They were considered by Perron, pp. 5-6, for n=1..11. See the examples below, and in the W. Lang link, Table 2.

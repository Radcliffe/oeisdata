%N A292570 Least k > 0 such that A171102(n) + A171102(k) is again a term of A171102, the pandigital numbers (having each digit from '0' to '9' at least once).
%C A292570 The first 9*9! pandigital numbers (having each digit 0-9 exactly once) are listed in A050278, which is extended to the infinite sequence A171102 of pandigital numbers having each digit 0-9 at least once.
%C A292570 For all n, a(n) is well defined, because to any pandigital number N = A171102(n) we can add the number M(N) = 123456789*10^k with k = # digits of N, which is pandigital (in the above extended sense) as well as is the sum N + M(N). In practice, there are much smaller solutions. We conjecture that there is always a 10-digit solution a(n) < 10^10.
%F A292570 a(n) = min { k in IN | A171102(k) + A171102(n) in A171102 }.
%e A292570 The smallest pandigital number A171102(1) = A050278(1) = 1023456789, added to itself, yields again a pandigital number, 2046913578. Therefore, a(1) = 1.
%e A292570 Similarly, A171102(1) = 1023456789 added to the second pandigital number A171102(2) = 1023456798, yields the pandigital number 2046913587. Therefore also a(2) = 1.
%e A292570 Considering the third pandigital number A171102(3) = 1023456879, we have to add itself in order to get a pandigital number, 2046913758. (Adding A171102(1) or A171102(2) yields 2046913668 and 2046913677, respectively, which are not pandigital.) Therefore a(3) = 3.

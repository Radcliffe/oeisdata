%N A164766 Smallest number m such that exactly n odd numbers can be seen as proper subsequences of m in decimal representation.
%C A164766 For any term first occurrences of positive even digits (2, 4, 6, 8) are in order. First 2 (if any) before first 4. Any number with an even digit d has all positive even digits < d. Same goes for odd digits (1, 3, 5, 7, 9). - _David A. Corneth_, Apr 12 2025

%F A164766 A045888(a(n)) = n and A045888(m) <> n for m < a(n).
%e A164766 a(6) = 135 as 135 is the smallest number such that exactly 6 numbers can be seen as proper subsequences of digits of 135 (namely 1, 3, 5, 13, 15, 35). Note that 135 is no proper substring of 135. - _David A. Corneth_, Apr 12 2025
%e A164766 153 is no term as the first 5 is before the first 3 and 5 is a larger odd digit than 3. - _David A. Corneth_, Apr 12 2025

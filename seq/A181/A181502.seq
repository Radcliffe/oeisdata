%N A181502 Triangle read by rows: number of solutions of n queens problem for given n and given maximal size of a connection component in the conflict constellation.
%C A181502 Torus solutions, i.e. solutions having an empty conflict constellation, are counted in column 1; this is caused by an interpretation of a queen not engaged in any conflict as an island in the conflict graph. Using the definition strictly, these queens should be removed from the graph and the numbers should appear in column 0, not column 1.

%e A181502 for n=4, there are only the two solutions 2-4-1-3 and 3-1-4-2. Both have two conflicts So the terms for n=4 are 0 (0 solutions for n=4 having 0 conflicts), 0, 2 (the two cited above), 0 and 0. These are members 10 to 15 of the sequence.
%Y A181502 Cf. A000170, A007705, A181499, A181500, A181501.

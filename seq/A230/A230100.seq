%N A230100 Numbers that can be expressed as (m + sum of digits of m) in exactly three ways.
%C A230100 Let f(n) = n + (sum of digits of n) = A062028(n).
%C A230100 Let g(m) = number of n such that f(n) = m (i.e. the number of inverses of m), A230093(m).
%C A230100 Numbers m with g(m) = 0 are called the Self or Colombian numbers, A003052.
%C A230100 Numbers m with g(m) = 1 give A225793.
%C A230100 Numbers m with g(m) = 2 give A230094.
%C A230100 The present sequence gives numbers m such that A230093(m) = 3.
%C A230100 The smallest term, a(1) = 10^13 + 1, was found by Narasinga Rao, who reports that Kaprekar verified that it is the smallest term. No details of Kaprekar's proof were given.
%C A230100 a(2) onwards were computed by _Donovan Johnson_, Oct 12 2013, and on Oct 20 2013 he completed a search of all numbers below 10^13 and verified that 10^13 + 1 is indeed the smallest term.
%C A230100 See A006064 for much more about this question.
%C A230100 Numbers m with g(m) = 4 give A377422. - _Daniel Mondot_, Oct 29 2024

%e A230100 There are exactly three numbers, 9999999999892, 9999999999901 and 10000000000000, whose image under n->f(n) is 10000000000001, so 10^13+1 is a member of the sequence.

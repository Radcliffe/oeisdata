%N A137273 Number of partitions of n-th Fibonacci number into Fibonacci parts obtained by iteratively dividing F(k) into F(n-1) and F(n-2); number of sub-Fibonacci sequences of length n starting with 1,0.
%C A137273 By a sub-Fibonacci sequence we mean a sequence of nonnegative integers b(i) with b(i) <= b(i-1) + b(i-2). Here we are taking b(1) = 1 and b(2) = 0.
%C A137273 In the above, b(i) (for i >= 2) is the number of times F(n-i+2) is divided into the next two smaller Fibonacci numbers in forming the partition.

%e A137273 For the sub-Fibonacci sequence 1,0,1,1,1,2, we split F(6)=8 into 5,3; split the 5 into 3,2; split one 3 into 2,1; and split both 2's into 1,1. This gives the partition [3,1^5].
%e A137273 [2^4] is the smallest partition of a Fibonacci number into Fibonacci parts that cannot be obtained in this way.

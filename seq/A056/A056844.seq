%N A056844 Number of polydiamonds: polyforms made from n diamonds.
%C A056844 If you look at Vicher's picture of the 40 4-celled polydiamonds (link below), near the middle of the picture is a polydiamond that looks like the traditional 2-D representation of a cube with an extra diamond stuck to the edge. Depending on how you orient the cube, there are actually 2 different ways to form this polydiamond, although there is no change in the perimeter shape. - Larry_Reeves(AT)intranetsolutions.com, Jun 22 2001; edited by _Aaron N.

%C A056844 From _Aaron N. Siegel_, May 18 2022: (Start)
%C A056844 The polydiamonds of order n form a subset of the polyiamonds of order 2n. In particular, the polydiamonds of order n are exactly the polyiamonds of order 2n that admit at least one tiling by diamonds.
%C A056844 Two polydiamonds are considered distinct only if their perimeter shapes are different (equivalently, if they represent distinct 2n-iamonds); the internal division into diamonds is not significant. This distinguishes A056844 from the related sequence A056845. The two sequences first diverge at n = 4.

%N A324691 List of all starting positions for which all moves away from zero occur at negative positions, and at least one such move occurs, according to the following rules. On the k-th step (k=1,2,3,...) move a distance of k in the direction of zero. If the number landed on has been landed on before, move a distance of k away.
%e A324691 Starting at 2, the points visited are 2,1,-1,-4,0 and the only move away from zero, from -1 to -4, occurs at a negative position.  Thus 2 is a term.

%N A298307 Start with a(0) = 1 and add at step n >= 0 the term 1 at position floor(4*(n+a(n))/3).
%C A298307 Sum_{i=0..n} a(i)/n = 3/4. For sequences of the type: a(0) = 1, in step n >= 0 add the term 1 at position floor(k*(n+a(n))), k rational number > 1 we have Sum_{i=0..n} a(i)/n = 1/k.
%e A298307 Define a sequence b whose terms are initially b(0)=1 and, for n > 0, b(n)=0, i.e., b = {1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,...}; then, for n = 0,1,2,..., increment b(floor(4*(n+b(n))/3)) by 1. For n >= 0, a(n) is the final value of b(n).

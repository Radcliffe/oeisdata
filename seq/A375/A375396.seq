%N A375396 Numbers not divisible by the square of any prime factor except (possibly) the least. Hooklike numbers.
%C A375396 Also numbers k such that the minima of the maximal anti-runs in the weakly increasing sequence of prime factors of k (with multiplicity) are identical. Here, an anti-run is a sequence with no adjacent equal parts, and the minima of the maximal anti-runs in a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal anti-run subsequences and taking the least term of each. Note the prime factors can alternatively be taken in weakly decreasing order.
%C A375396 The complement is a superset of A036785 = products of a squarefree number and a prime power.
%C A375396 The asymptotic density of this sequence is (1/zeta(2)) * (1 + Sum_{p prime} (1/(p^2-p)) / Product_{primes q <= p} (1 + 1/q)) = 0.884855661165... . - _Amiram Eldar_, Oct 26 2024

%e A375396 The prime factors of 300 are {2,2,3,5,5}, with maximal anti-runs {{2},{2,3,5},{5}}, with minima (2,2,5), so 300 is not in the sequence.

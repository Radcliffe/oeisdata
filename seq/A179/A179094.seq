%N A179094 Disorder number of the n X n grid graph.
%C A179094 Old name: Fill an n X n array with various permutations of the integers 1, 2, 3, 4... n^2. Define the organization number of the n X n array to be the following: Start at 1, count the rectilinear steps to reach 2, then the rectilinear steps to reach 3, etc. Add them up. The array that has the maximum organization number would be the "most disorganized." This sequence is the sequence showing the most disorganized number for n X n arrays starting at 1 X 1.
%C A179094 Similar to sequence A047838.
%C A179094 This is basically a traveling salesman variant. - _D. S. McNeil_, Aug 26 2010
%C A179094 Alternate description (of the algorithm, now in example): To each k in 1..n^2, associate a unique position p(k) = (row(k), col(k)) with row(k), col(k) in 1..n (= 1, ..., n). Then organization_number(p) = Sum_{k=2..n^2} |p(k) - p(k-1)|, where |(x,y)| = |x| + |y| is the taxicab- or 1-norm. The sum can also be written as |p' - p"|, where p' = p(2..n^2), p" = p(1..n^2-1) are vectors with n^2-1 2D-components, and |.| is again the 1-norm. - _M. F. Hasler_, Sep 05 2025

%F A179094 A possible formula: a(n) = 0 for n=1, n^3-n-1 for odd n > 1, n^3-3 for even n? - _D. S. McNeil_, Aug 26 2010
%F A179094 Let b(n) correspond to McNeil's formula. Then b(n) <= a(n) <= b(n) + 1 (see link). - _Sela Fried_, Nov 28 2023
%F A179094 Empirical G.f.: x^2*(5+13*x+10*x^2-6*x^3+x^4+x^5)/((1-x)^4*(1+x)^2). - _Colin Barker_, Mar 29 2012

%e A179094 To compute an organization number, we proceed as follows:
%e A179094 a) Fill an n X n array with a permutation of (1, ..., n^2).
%e A179094 b) List the positions (row, column) of the elements, from 1 to n^2.
%e A179094 c) Sum the absolute value of the differences between the rows of consecutive integers, and also for the columns of consecutive integers. The organization number is the sum of the two sums.
%e A179094 For instance, the permutation 8, 3, 6, 5, 9, 1, 2, 7, 4 gives the 3 X 3 array
%e A179094    8 3 6
%e A179094    5 9 1
%e A179094    2 7 4
%e A179094 (Here the next integer is always a knight's move away, except for the final 9, which gives a result of 7*3 + 2 = 23. This is not the only permutation that will give 23, but this is why I wonder if the sequence is the same as A098499.) [Remark: It isn't, the terms for n=4 differ. - _M. F. Hasler_, Sep 05 2025]
%e A179094 Now we list the integers with their row and column:
%e A179094   number, row, column
%e A179094    1, 2, 3
%e A179094    2, 3, 1
%e A179094    3, 1, 2
%e A179094    4, 3, 3
%e A179094    5, 2, 1
%e A179094    6, 1, 3
%e A179094    7, 3, 2
%e A179094    8, 1, 1
%e A179094    9, 2, 2
%e A179094 Traveling from 1 to 9, the differences in the row numbers are 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1 (a sum of 12) and the differences in the column numbers are 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1 (a sum of 11), so we get again the organization number 23.

%N A085844 Numbers equal to a permutation (or rearrangement) of the digits of the sum of their proper divisors. Rearrangements which cause leading zeros are excluded.
%C A085844 Perfect numbers (A000396) are a subsequence. Perfect numbers are defined as numbers equal to the sum of their proper divisors. The numbers in this sequence are not perfect, but are "permutably perfect" since they are equal to a permutation of the sum of their proper divisors.
%C A085844 Note a(79)=195921 and a(80)=199251 and these are both permutations of each other. The same is true of a(90)=226944 and a(93)=244692.

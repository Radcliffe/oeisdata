%N A152389 Number of steps in Conway's Game of Life for a row of n cells to stabilize.
%C A152389 A pattern is said to have stabilized if it consists entirely of a (possibly empty) periodic component and zero or more spaceships, such that the spaceships will never interact with each other or with the periodic part.

%e A152389 From _Eric M. Schmidt_, Aug 15 2012: (Start)
%e A152389 A 10-cell straight line evolves into a periodic pattern (the pentadecathlon) in two steps. Therefore a(10) = 2. (Based on example in A098720)
%e A152389 A 33-cell straight line evolves, in 387 steps, into a pattern consisting of a periodic component and four gliders. The pattern has not yet stabilized since the gliders will eventually collide.
%e A152389 A 56-cell straight line evolves, in 246 steps, into a pattern consisting of a periodic component and four gliders. The gliders will never collide with each other or with the periodic component, so the pattern has stabilized. Thus, a(56) = 246. (End)

%N A127388 Signature-permutation of a Catalan automorphism, a self-inverse variant of A127379.
%C A127388 This automorphism is RIBS-transformation (explained in A122200) of the automorphism A127387.

%o A127388 (Scheme) ;; Implementation of this automorphism, destructive, that acts on S-expressions, i.e. list-structures:
%o A127388 (define (*A127388! s) (for-each *A127387! s) s)
%Y A127388 The number of cycles and the number of fixed points in range [A014137(n-1)..A014138(n-1)] of this involution are given by A127386 and A086625 shifted once right (this automorphism has the same fixed points as A127379/A127380). A127302(a(n)) = A127302(n) holds for all n.

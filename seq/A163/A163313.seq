%N A163313 Triangle read by rows, A010766 convolved with A014668 (diagonalized as an infinite lower triangular matrix).
%C A163313 This is an eigentriangle (i.e., a lower triangular matrix * a diagonalized version of its eigensequence); A014668 is the eigensequence of triangle A010766.
%C A163313 Row sums = A014668 starting (1, 3, 7, 16, 33, 71, 143, ...).
%C A163313 Sum of n-th row terms = rightmost term of next row.

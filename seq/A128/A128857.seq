%N A128857 a(n) = least number m beginning with 1 such that the quotient m/n is obtained merely by shifting the leftmost digit 1 of m to the right end.
%C A128857 a(n) is simply the decimal period of the fraction n/(10n-1). Thus, we have: n/(10n-1) = a(n)/(10^A128858(n)-1). With the usual convention that the decimal period of 0 is zero, that definition would allow the extension a(0)=0. a(n) is also the period of the decadic integer -n/(10n-1). - _Gerard P.

%e A128857 a(4) = 102564 since this is the smallest number that begins with 1 and which is divided by 4 when the first digit 1 is made the last digit (102564/4 = 25641).

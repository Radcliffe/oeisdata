%N A119676 a(0)=1. a(n) = n-th integer from among those positive integers which are coprime to the product of the earlier terms of the sequence.
%e A119676 10 is the product of terms a(0) through a(3). 1,3,7,9,11,...is the sequence of positive integers coprime to 10. 9 is the 4th term of this sequence, so a(4) therefore is 9.

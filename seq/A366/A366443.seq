%N A366443 Number of free polyominoes of site-perimeter n.
%C A366443 This sequence counts free connected (via common edges) polyominoes with given site-perimeter. The site-perimeter of a polyomino is the number of cells that are adjacent to it (via common edges). This sequence allows holes of any kind.
%H A366443 John Mason, <a href="/A366443/a366443_2.pdf">Examples</a>
%e A366443 a(4) = a(6) = a(7) = 1 as the monomino, domino and L-shaped tromino are the only polyominoes with site perimeter 4, 6 and 7 respectively.
%e A366443 a(5) = 0 as no polyomino has a site-perimeter of 5.
%e A366443 a(8) = 5 as the straight tromino, square tetromino, T-tetromino, S-tetromino and cross pentomino are the only polyominoes with site perimeter 8. See link "Examples".
%Y A366443 Cf. A000105 (free polyominoes), A001971 (the maximum size of a polyomino with site-perimeter n is given by A001971(n-2)), A057730 (perimeter instead of site-perimeter), A216820 (fixed version of current sequence).
%Y A366443 Column sums of A338211 (without the column for 0-celled polyominoes).

%N A005603 Smallest prime beginning a complete Cunningham chain (of the second kind) of length n.
%C A005603 The chain begins with a prime number p; next term p' (a prime) is produced forming 2p-1; next term p"=2p'-1, etc. "Complete" means that each chain is exactly n primes long (i.e. the chain cannot be a subchain of another one). That is why this sequence is slightly different from A064812, where the 6th term (33301) is smaller than here (385591) but is the second one of a seven primes sequence and therefore doesn't *start* a sequence.
%C A005603 According to Augustin's web site, the numbers 107588900851484911, 69257563144280941, 3203000719597029781 are also in the sequence. - _Dmitry Kamenetsky_, May 14 2009

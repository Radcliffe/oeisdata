%N A345738 Decimal expansion of (2*G+1)/Pi, where G is Catalan's constant (A006752).
%C A345738 A projectile is launched with an initial speed v at angle theta above the horizon. Assuming that the gravitational acceleration g is uniform and neglecting the air resistance, the trajectory is a part of a parabola whose expected length, averaged over theta uniformly chosen at random from the range [0, Pi/2], is c * v^2/g, where c is this constant.
%C A345738 The length of the trajectory as a function of theta is L(theta) = (v^2/g)*(sin(theta) + cos(theta)^2*log((1+sin(theta))/(1-sin(theta)))/2). L(theta) goes from 0 to 1 between theta = 0 and Pi/2. It has a maximum at theta = 0.985514... (A345737), and a unique value at 0 <= theta < 0.599677... (A345739). The average length (c * v^2/g) occurs at theta = 0.5152731296... (29.522975... degrees).

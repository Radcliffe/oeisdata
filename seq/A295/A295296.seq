%N A295296 Numbers n such that the sum of their divisors + the number of ones in their binary expansion = 2n; numbers for which A000203(n) + A000120(n) = 2n.
%C A295296 Numbers n such that their binary weight is equal to their deficiency.
%C A295296 Numbers n such that A000120(n) = A033879(n), or equally A000203(n) = A005187(n), or equally A001065(n) = A011371(n).
%C A295296 2^(2^k-1) * (2^(2^k) + 1) is in the sequence if and only if (2^(2^k) + 1) is a (Fermat) prime (A019434) which as of today is known to be the case for 0 <= k <= 4 giving the terms 3, 10, 136, 32896 and 2147516416. - _David A. Corneth_, Nov 26 2017
%C A295296 It would be nice to know whether 315 is the only term that is neither in A191363 nor a power of two.
%C A295296 Any term that is either a square or twice a square (in A028982) must be odious (in A000069), and vice versa.
%C A295296 If there's an odd term below 10^30 besides 315 then it must be divisible by a prime >= 23. - _David A. Corneth_, Nov 27 2017
%C A295296 221753180448460815 is odd and also a term of this sequence. - _Alexander Violette_, Dec 24 2020

%e A295296 A000203(315) = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 15 + 21 + 35 + 45 + 63 + 105 + 315 = 624. 2*315 - 624 = 6, and when 315 is written in binary, 100111011, we see that it has six 1-bits. Thus 315 is included in the sequence.

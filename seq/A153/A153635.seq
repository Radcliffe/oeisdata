%N A153635 Primes of the form 4*x^3 + 27*y^2, with x positive or negative.
%C A153635 Hardy and Wright: If there are an infinite number of these primes, then there are infinitely many cubic polynomials with integer coefficients and prime discriminant. It would also resolve the open conjecture that there are infinitely many non-isomorphic elliptic curves defined over the rationals and having prime conductor.

%C A153635 Granville: "The most desired open problem in [asymptotic sieves] is to show that 4a^3 + 27b^2 is prime for infinitely many pairs of integers a, b (this is of interest because if 4a^3 + 27b^2 is prime then it is usually the conductor of the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + ax + b)." - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Jun 06 2013

%F A356357 a(n) = A001358(A106132(n)).
%e A356357 The 1st semiprime is 4, which is congruent to 7 (mod 1), so 4 is in the sequence.
%e A356357 The 2nd semiprime is 6, which is not congruent to 7 (mod 2), so 6 is not in the sequence.
%e A356357 The 3rd semiprime is 9, which is not congruent to 7 (mod 3), so 9 is not in the sequence.
%e A356357 The 7th semiprime is 21, which is congruent to 7 (mod 7), so 21 is in the sequence.

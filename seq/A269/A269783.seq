%N A269783 Starting with a(0) = 0, the subsequence of immediate successors of the instances of each integer n in the sequence is n, n-1, n+1, n-2, n+2, ... for n > 0 and n, n+1, n-1, n+2, n-2, ... for n <= 0.
%C A269783 Note that "subsequence" refers to any sequence of values taken at increasing indices in the base sequence, not necessarily consecutive terms.
%C A269783 In more detail, for any integer n, let i(k) be the index of the k-th occurrence of n in this sequence, i.e., { i(1), i(2), i(3), ...} = { i | a(i) = n }. Then S(n) := (a(i(1)+1), a(i(2)+1), a(i(3)+1), ...) = (n, n-1, n+1, n-2, ...) if n > 0 and S(n) = (n, n+1, n-1, n+2, ...) if n <= 0. This property, together with the choice if the starting value a(0) = 0, uniquely defines the sequence, because it unambiguously defines the successor of any given term. - _M. F. Hasler_, Mar 07 2016
%C A269783 Every ordered pair of integers occurs exactly once in this sequence.
%C A269783 Indeed, given any pair (n,m), there is a unique k such that m-n = (-1)^(k-[n>0])*floor(k/2), and by definition the pair (n,m) occurs exactly at the k-th occurrence of n. It remains to show that all integers occur infinitely often. - _M. F. Hasler_, Mar 07 2016

%F A269783 The immediate successor of any term a(j) = n is a(j+1) = n + (-1)^(k-e) * floor(k/2), where k = # { i <= j | a(i) = n } (meaning that a(j) is the k-th occurrence of n in the sequence), and e := [n>0] = (1 if n > 0 and 0 if n <= 0). - _M. F. Hasler_, Mar 07 2016
%e A269783 a(0) is 0. As a(0) is the first 0 in the sequence, a(1) is the first term in the sequence 0, 1, -1, 2, -2 (incidently A001057, but ignoring the offset of that sequence), nameley 0. Now a(1) is the second 0, so we take the second term in A001057, and a(2) = 1. For the first 1, we take the first term associated with 1, which is 1, and a(3) = 1. Now we have the second 1, we take the second term of 1, 0, 2, -1, ..., which is again 0.

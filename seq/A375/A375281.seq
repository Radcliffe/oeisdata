%N A375281 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of distinct positive integers such that for all n > 1 a(n-1), a(n) do not have the same number of distinct prime divisors, whereas the squarefree kernel of their product is a primorial number.
%C A375281 In other words omega(a(n-1)) != omega(a(n)) whilst rad(a(n-1)*a(n)) is a term in A002110, where omega is A001221 and rad is A007947. In general, primes appear consequent to primorial terms (a(11,12) = 18,5 is an exception). Conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers, with primes in order.
%C A375281 From _Michael De Vlieger_, Aug 19 2024: (Start)
%C A375281 Let r be squarefree and define lineage S_r to be the list of numbers k such that rad(k) = r. Then S_r = r*R_r, where R_r is the list of numbers m such that rad(m) | r, hence k = m*r. R_r is the sorted, vectorized tensor product of prime divisor power ranges { p^j : p | r, j >= 0 }. The smallest term of S_r is r itself; it is the only squarefree number in the lineage S_r. S_1 = {1}, but S_r, r > 1 is infinite.
%C A375281 By construction, this sequence features k in S_r in order on account of the squarefree kernel constraint. Example, S_6 = A033845; S_6(1) = a(3) = 6, S_6(2) = a(7) = 12, S_6(3) = a(11) = 18, etc.
%C A375281 Corollary: Prime powers p^j appear in order.
%C A375281 Therefore, if this sequence is a permutation of natural numbers, we should see all squarefree numbers in this sequence, and all k in S_r should appear in order. (End)

%e A375281 The sequence starts a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2 since this is the earliest pair of positive integers with differing numbers of distinct prime divisors (omega(1) = 0, omega(2) = 1) such that the squarefree kernel rad(1*2) = 2 = A002110(1) is a primorial number.
%e A375281 a(3) = 6 since 3,4,5, all have omega = 1, the same number of distinct prime divisors as 2, but omega(6) = 2 and rad(2*6) = 6 = A002110(2).

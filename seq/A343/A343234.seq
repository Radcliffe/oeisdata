%N A343234 Triangle T read by rows: lower triangular Riordan matrix of the Toeplitz type with first column A067687.
%C A343234 This infinite lower triangular Riordan matrix T is the so-called L-eigen-matrix of the infinite lower triangular Riordan matrix A027293 (but with offset 0 for rows and columns). Such eigentriangles have been considered by _Paul Barry_ in the paper given as a link in A186020.
%C A343234 This means that E is the L-eigen-matrix of an infinite lower triangular matrix M if M*E = L*(E - I), with the unit matrix I and the matrix L with elements L(i, j) = delta_{i, j-1} (Kronecker's delta-symbol; first upper diagonal with 1's).
%C A343234 Therefore, this notion is analogous to calling sequence S an L-eigen-sequence of matrix M if M*vec(S) = L.vec(S) (or vec(S) is an eigensequence of M - L with eigenvalue 0), used by Bernstein and Sloane, see the links in A155002.
%C A343234 L*(E - I) is the E matrix after elimination of the main diagonal and then the first row, and starting with offset 0. Because for infinite lower triangular matrices L^{tr}.L = I (tr stands for transposed), this leads to M = L*(I - E^{-1}) or E = (I - L^{tr}*M)^{-1}.
%C A343234 Note that _Gary W. Adamson_ uses a different notion: E is the eigentriangle of a triangle T if the columns of E are the columns j of T multiplied by the sequence elements B_j of B with o.g.f. x/(1 - x*G(x)), with the o.g.f. G(x) of column no. 1 of T.  Or E(i, j) = T(i, j)*B(j). In short: sequence B is the L-eigen-sequence of the infinite lower triangular matrix T (but with offset 1): T*vec(B) = L.vec(B). See, e.g., A143866.
%C A343234 Thanks to _Gary W. Adamson_ for motivating my occupation with such eigentriangles and eigensequences.
%C A343234 The first column of the present triangle T is A067687, which is then shifted downwards (Riordan of Toeplitz type).
%F A343234 Matrix elements: T(n, m) = A067687(n-m), for n >= m >= 0, and 0 otherwise.
%F A343234 O.g.f. of row polynomials R(n,x) = Sum_{m=0..n} T(n, m)*x^m is
%F A343234 G(z, x) = 1/((1 - z*P(z))*(1 - x*z)), with the o.g.f. P of A000041 (number of partitions).
%F A343234 O.g.f. column m: G_m(x) = x^m/(1 - x*P(x)), for m >= 0.

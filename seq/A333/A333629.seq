%N A333629 Least k such that the runs-resistance of the k-th composition in standard order is n.
%C A333629 A composition of n is a finite sequence of positive integers summing to n. The k-th composition in standard order (row k of A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again.
%C A333629 For the operation of taking the sequence of run-lengths of a finite sequence, runs-resistance is defined as the number of applications required to reach a singleton.

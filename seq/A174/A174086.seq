%N A174086 Number of permutations of length n with no consecutive triples i,...i+r,...i+2r (mod n) for all r, and for all equal spacings d.
%C A174086 Here we count both the sequence 1,2,3 (r=1) as a progression in 1,2,3,0,4,5, (note d=1) and in 1,0,2,4,3,5 (here, d=2).
%e A174086 For n=4 note a(4) is the same as the value in A165963 since there are no other distances that can be used (i.e. only d=1).
%Y A174086 Cf. A165963, A174084, A174085, A174087.

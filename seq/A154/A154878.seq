%N A154878 Numbers whose trajectory under iteration of sum of cubes of digits eventually turns out to be 370.
%C A154878 All the numbers are of the form 3n+1. The iteration halts at 370 because 370 itself is equal to the sum of its digits cube.
%e A154878 Taking 34 as example, 3^3+4^3=91, 9^3+1=730, 7^3+3^3+0^3=370

%N A133926 Number of equivalence classes of compositions of n into parts of size 2 and 3 under the following equivalence relation: We make a "move" by changing three consecutive 2s into two consecutive 3s or vice versa. Two compositions are equivalent if we can reach one from the other by a series of moves.
%C A133926 Sequence A133925 counts the equivalence classes with exactly one element.

%F A133926 a(n) = a(n-2) + a(n-3) - a(n-6). - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Oct 12 2013
%F A133926 G.f.: 1/(1-x^2-x^3+x^6). - _Joerg Arndt_, Oct 12 2013
%e A133926 a(5) = 2 because the two compositions 23 and 32 are inequivalent. a(6) = 1 because the two compositions 222 and 33 are equivalent.

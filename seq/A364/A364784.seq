%N A364784 a(n) = n for n <= 2. Thereafter if a(n-1) is a novel term, a(n) = a(a(k)) where k is the greatest prior term < a(n-1); otherwise, a(n) = number of times a(n-1) has been repeated.
%C A364784 The definition is similar to that of A364749.
%C A364784 With the exception of a(3) = a(4) = 1, every term a(r-1) = 1 occurs prior to record term a(r), and a(r) is the number of times 1 has been repeated so far.
%C A364784 The subsequence of records is A000027, and the subsequence {a(r)} is a copy of the sequence itself, which is fractal (see Example).

%e A364784 The given terms are a(1) = 1 and a(2) = 2. Since 2 is a novel term and 1 is the greatest prior term < 2, a(3) = a(1) = 1, and since a(3) is the second occurrence of 1, a(4) = 1 (the number of times 1 has been repeated). Now 1 has occurred 3 times so a(5) = 2, and so on.
%e A364784 The sequence can be represented as an irregular table in which the n-th row starts with the n-th record, and ends with the term = 1 which precedes the next record. Thus the first column is A000027, and the second column is the sequence itself.

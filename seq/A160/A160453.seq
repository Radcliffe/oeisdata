%N A160453 Numbers n which have a prime divisor p such that 1 is the only positive integer which divides n/p^m and is congruent to 1 modulo p, where p^(m+1) does not divide n.
%C A160453 The solvability of a group whose order is a(n) can be reduced to the solvability of smaller group using the Sylow theorems, provided the order is not a prime.
%C A160453 80 is not a member of this sequence, but is a member of A168186. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Jan 26 2010

%N A153013 Starting with input 0, find the binary value of the input. Then interpret resulting string of 1's and 0's as prime-based numbers, as follows: 0's are separators, uninterrupted strings of 1's are interpreted from right to left as exponents of the prime numbers. Output is returned as input for the next number in sequence.

%C A153013 Iterates of map f : n -> A005940(1+n), (Doudna-sequence, but with starting offset zero) starting from the initial value 0. Conversely, the unique infinite sequence such that a(n) = A156552(a(n+1)) and a(0) = 0.
%C A153013 Note that map f can also form cycles, like 7 <-> 8 (A005940(1+7) = 8, A005940(1+8) = 7).
%C A153013 On the other hand, this sequence cannot ever fall into a loop because 0 is not in the range of map f, for n=0.., while f is injective on [1..]. Thus the values obtained by this sequence are not bounded, although there might be more nonmonotonic positions like for example there is from a(10) = 16 to a(11) = 11.
%C A153013 The formula A008966(a(n+1)) = A085357(a(n)) tells that the squarefreeness of the next term a(n+1) is determined by whether the previous term a(n) is a fibbinary number (A003714) or not. Numerous other such correspondences hold, and they hold also for any other trajectories outside of this sequence.
%C A153013 Even and odd terms alternate. No two squares can occur in succession because A106737 obtains even values for all squares > 1 and A000005 is odd for all squares. More directly this is seen from the fact that the rightmost 1-bit in the binary expansion of any square is always alone.

%N A381976 a(n) is the number of distinct solutions to the Partridge Puzzle of size n.
%C A381976 a(n) is the number of packings of squares of side 1..n to fill the square of side n(n+1)/2 under the condition that there are: 1 square of size 1 X 1, 2 squares of size 2 X 2, 3 squares of size 3 X 3, ..., n squares of size n X n.
%C A381976 The sequence comes from the formula 1^3 + 2^3 + ... + n^3 = (1+2+...+n)^2 = (n(n+1)/2)^2 (Nicomachus's theorem), so that the areas of the squares sum up to the area of the big square.
%C A381976 Rotations and mirrorings of the packings are not counted as distinct (there are in total 8 distinct variations of each packing).
%C A381976 Interestingly, for n = 9 the area of the big square is equal to 45*45 = 2025 making this problem a problem of the year 2025.

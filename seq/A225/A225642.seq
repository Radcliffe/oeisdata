%N A225642 Irregular table read by rows: n-th row gives distinct values of successively iterated Landau-like functions for n, starting with the initial value n.
%C A225642 The leftmost column of table (the initial term of each row, T(n,1)) is n, corresponding to lcm(n) computed from the singular {n} partition of n, after which, on the same row, each further term T(n,i) is computed by finding such a partition {p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_k} of n so that value of lcm(T(n, i-1), p_1, p_2, ..., p_k) is maximized, until finally A003418(n) is reached, which will be listed as the last term of row n (as the result would not change after that, if we continued the same process).
%C A225642 Of possible interest: which numbers occur only once in this table, and which occur multiple times? And how many times, if each number occurs only a finite number of times?
%C A225642 Each number occurs a finite number of times: rows are increasing, first column is increasing, so n will occur last in row n, leftmost column. Primes (and other numbers too) occur once. - _Alois P. Heinz_, May 25 2013

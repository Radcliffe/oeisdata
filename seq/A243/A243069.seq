%N A243069 a(n) = smallest natural number that has not yet occurred among the first n terms of A126917.
%C A243069 Facilitates the computing of A126917.
%C A243069 a(n) grows only when n is a prime. A243498 gives the values at those points.
%H A243069 Antti Karttunen, <a href="/A243069/b243069.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..10000</a>
%F A243069 For all n, a(n) <= A126917(n+1).
%F A243069 For n >= 2, if A126917(n) > a(n-1) [when n is composite], a(n) = a(n-1).
%e A243069 The first eight terms of A126917 are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 8, 6, 11. In range [1,1] the first that has not yet occurred is 2, in range [1,2] it is 3, in range [1,3] it is 4, in range [1,4] it is still 4, in range [1,5] it is 6, in range [1,6] it is still 6, in range [1,7] it is 7, in range [1,8] it is still 7, thus the first eight terms of this sequence are 2, 3, 4, 4, 6, 6, 7, 7.

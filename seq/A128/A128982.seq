%N A128982 If in a line of n persons every n-th person is eliminated until only one person is left, which position P should one assume in the original lineup to avoid being eliminated?
%C A128982 The difference between this, A007495 and the diagonal of A032434 is that for each of the n-1 elimination processes, counting from 1 to n starts at the lowest position in the line that is still occupied, not right after the most recently eliminated position. Wrapping around when n exceeds the number of residual occupied positions still occurs in circular fashion as in the original Josephus problem. - _R. J. Mathar_, May 07 2007

%F A128982 If n is prime then P = n - 1. If n is prime + 1 then P = 2.
%e A128982 Elimination at n=6: 1,2,3,4,5,6 -> 1,2,3,4,5 -> 2,3,4,5 -> 2,4,5 -> 2,4 -> 2. After the 3 is eliminated, counting does not start at 4 but again at 2.

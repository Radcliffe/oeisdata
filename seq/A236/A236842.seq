%N A236842 Numbers that occur as results of remultiplication (GF(2)[X] -> N) of some number; A234742 sorted and duplicates removed.
%C A236842 This sequence gives the range of A234742.
%C A236842 After 0 and 1 these are numbers n that have such a multiset of prime divisors p, q, ..., w (p * q * ... * w = n, with p, q, ..., w not necessarily distinct) that it can be arranged so that in at least one subset of divisors of n: (p, q, w), (pq, w), (pw, q), (p, qw), (pqw), ..., all divisors (for example, in the second case: pq and w) encode by their binary representations irreducible factors of polynomial ring over GF(2) (i.e., all occur in A014580) and their (ordinary) product is n.
%C A236842 Above condition implies that none of the terms of A091209 occur here.

%F A236842 Use the characteristic function A236862(n) to determine whether n is a term of this sequence or not.
%F A236842 Specifically:
%F A236842 All numbers encoding an irreducible polynomial in GF(2)[X] (A014580) occur in this sequence. This means that a prime is in this sequence if and only if it is in A091206.
%F A236842 On the other hand, a composite integer n is in this sequence if and only if it is either in A014580 or it has such a proper factor k (1<k<n, k|n) that both k and n/k are members of this sequence.

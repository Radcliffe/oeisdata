%N A276006 Numbers with at least one hit in their factorial base representations (see comments for the definition); positions of nonzeros in A276004 & A276007.
%C A276006 We say there is a "hit" in factorial base representation (A007623) of n when there is any such pair of nonzero digits d_i and d_j in positions i > j so that (i - d_i) = j. Here the rightmost (least significant digit) occurs at position 1. This sequence gives all numbers that contain at least one such hit, meaning that there exists such a nonzero digit d_i in some position i of their factorial base representation that the digit at the position (i - d_i) is nonzero.

%e A276006 3 ("11" in factorial base) is included because the most significant 1 at position 2 hits the least significant 1 at position 1 as (2-1) = 1.
%e A276006 17 ("221") is included because the most significant 2 at position 3 hits the 1 at position 1 as (3-2) = 1.

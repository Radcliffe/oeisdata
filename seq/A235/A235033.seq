%N A235033 Numbers which are factored to a different set of primes in Z as to the irreducible polynomials in GF(2)[X].
%C A235033 If a term is included in this sequence, then all its ordinary multiples as well as any "A048720-multiples" are included as well. (Cf. the characteristic function A235046.)
%C A235033 The sequence which gives all such n that A001222(n) differs from A091222(n) is a subsequence of this sequence.

%e A235033 5 is included in this sequence, because, although it is prime, its binary representation '101' encodes a polynomial x^2 + 1, which is reducible in polynomial ring GF(2)[X] as (x+1)(x+1), i.e., 5 = A048720(3,3).
%e A235033 9 is included in this sequence, as it factors as 3*3 in Z, the corresponding polynomial (bin.repr. '1001'): x^3 + 1 factors as (x+1)(x^2+x+1), i.e., 9 = A048720(3,7), so even although the number of prime/irreducible factors is the same, the factors themselves (i.e., their binary codes) are not exactly the same, thus 9 is included here.
%e A235033 On the other hand, none of 2, 3, 4, 11 and 111 are included in this sequence because they occur in the complement sequence, A235032 (please see examples there).

%Y A235033 Gives the positions of nonzeros in A236380, i.e., n such that A234741(n) <> A234742(n).

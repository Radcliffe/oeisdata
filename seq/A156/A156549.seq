%N A156549 Race between primes having an odd/even number of zeros in their binary representation.
%C A156549 See A066148 and A066149 for primes with an even/odd number of zeros in their binary representation. Sequence A130911 shows the race between primes having an odd/even number of ones in their binary representation. In this sequence (and A130911), it appears that the primes with an odd number of zeros (or ones) dominate the primes with an even number of zeros (or ones). In general, it appears that the sequences grow for primes having an odd number of bits and "rest" for primes having an even number of bits.

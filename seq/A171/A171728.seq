%N A171728 Numbers k which establish records for floor(log(log(log(2^k)))).
%C A171728 Morris writes: E. Thorp introduced the following card shuffling model. Suppose the number of cards n is even. Cut the deck into two equal piles. Drop the first card from the left pile or from the right pile according to the outcome of a fair coin flip. Then drop from the other pile. Continue this way until both piles are empty. We show that if n is a power of 2 then the mixing time of the Thorp shuffle is O(log^3 n). Previously, the best known bound was O(log^4 n).
%C A171728 This sequence seems to be unrelated to the Thorp shuffle in which the bound is log^3 x = (log x)^3 rather than log log log x. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Sep 04 2015

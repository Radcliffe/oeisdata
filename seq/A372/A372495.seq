%N A372495 Number of inequivalent unate functions of n or fewer variables.
%C A372495 A Boolean function is unate in a variable if it is either nondecreasing or nonincreasing with respect to that variable. Therefore in the circuit representation of unate functions, each variable appears either in its original form or in complemented form. Thus x⊕y = (x∧¬y)∨(¬x∧y) is not a unate function.
%C A372495 Moreover, two Boolean functions are said to be equivalent if they are equivalent under the permutation of variables. For example, f(x,y)=x is equivalent to f(x,y)=y under the permutation of input variables.

%e A372495 The list of all 2-variable inequivalent unate functions f(x,y) is 0,1,x,¬x,x∧y,¬x∧y,¬x∧¬y,x∨y,¬x∨y,¬x∨¬y. So a(2)=10.

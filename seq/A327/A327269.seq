%N A327269 Smallest modulus of any integer n X n determinant with top row 1,2,...,n and rows nonzero and pairwise orthogonal.
%C A327269 Also a(n) = A327267(p_1...p_n), with p_j = j-th prime, since p_1...p_n is the Heinz code for the multiset {1,2,3,...,n}. For more details see Pinner and Smyth link.

%e A327269 a(3)=42 since det([1,2,3],[1,-2,1],[4,1,-2]) = 42 and is the smallest positive determinant with top row [1,2,3] and all rows orthogonal.
%Y A327269 Subsequence of A327267-- see comments; A327271 is similar, but determinant's top row is n 1's; A327272 is similar, but determinant's top row is 1,2,2^2,...,2^n.

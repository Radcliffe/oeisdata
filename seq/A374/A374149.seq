%N A374149 Decimal expansion of the minimum volume of an axis-aligned bounding box which includes the shortest minimum-link polygonal chain joining all the vertices of the cube {0,1}^3.
%C A374149 It has been proved that it is not possible to join the 8 vertices of a cube with a polygonal chain that has fewer than 6 edges (see Links, Optimal cycles enclosing all the nodes of a k-dimensional hypercube, Theorem 2.2).
%C A374149 Here we are considering the additional constraint that asks to minimize the volume of the Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) including the above-mentioned optimal polygonal chain consisting of only 6 connected line segments and that joins all the vertices of the cube [0,1] X [0,1] X [0,1].
%C A374149 Given phi = (1+sqrt(5))/2, the well-known golden ratio (see A001622), a valid polygonal chain is (0, 1, 0)-(0, 0, 0)-((1+phi)/2, 0, (1+phi)/2)-(1/2, 1+phi, 1/2)-((1-phi)/2, 0, (1+phi)/2)-(1, 0, 0)-(1, 1, 0) (see Links, p. 164), and consequently the minimum volume AABB is [(1-phi)/2, (1+phi)/2] X [0, 1+phi] X [0, (1+phi)/2].
%C A374149 As noted by _Hugo Pfoertner_, the present sequence is also given by phi^5/2 (i.e., A244593/2).

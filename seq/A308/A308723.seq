%N A308723 Total number of parts in all m-cyclic compositions of n (where each part of size m can be colored with one of m colors).
%C A308723 Unmarked cyclic compositions (originally studied by Sommerville (1909)) are equivalence classes of ordered partitions of n such that two such partitions are equivalent iff one can be obtained from the other by rotation.
%C A308723 The so-called "m-cyclic compositions" of n are cyclic compositions of n such that each part of size m can be colored with any one of m colors. (Colored ordered partitions were originally introduced by Agarwal (2000). The theory of Bower about transforms in the web link below is a generalization of this idea.)
%C A308723 If b(n) is the number of m-colored compositions of n, then (b(n): n >= 1) is the CIK transform of the sequence 1, 2, 3, ... and it has the g.f. -Sum_{n >= 1} (phi(s)/s) * log(1 - C(x^s)), where C(x) = x + 2*x^2 + 3*x^3 + 4*x^4 + ... = x/(1-x)^2. (See Bower's link about transforms for information about the CIK transform.) Thus, b(n) = A032198(n) for n >= 1, and its g.f. and formula were also derived in Gibson (2017) and Gibson et al. (2018).
%C A308723 In general, if c = (c(m): m >= 1) is the input sequence and (b_k(n): n >= 1) is the output sequence under the CIK[k] transform of c, then b_n = (CIK c)_n = Sum_{k = 1..n} (CIK[k] c)_n = Sum_{k = 1..n} b_k(n) for all n >= 1 (see Bower's web link on transforms).
%C A308723 The g.f. of (b_k(n): n >= 1) is Sum_{n >= 1} b_k(n)*x^k = (1/k)*Sum_{d|k} phi(d) * A(x^d)^(k/d). It follows that Sum_{n >= 1, k >= 1} b_k(n)*x^n*y^k = -Sum_{d >= 1} (phi(d)/d) * log(1 - y^d *A(x^d)) (with the understanding that b_k(n) = 0 for k > n).
%C A308723 For n >= 1, let d(n) = Sum_{k >= 1} k*b_k(n) = total number of parts of in all compositions of n under the CIK transform of c = (c(m): m >= 1). Thus, d(n) is the total number of parts in all cyclic compositions of n where each part of size m can be colored with c(m) colors.
%C A308723 To obtain the g.f. of (d(n): n >= 1) = (Sum_{k = 1..n} k*b_k(n): n >= 1), we differentiate the bivariate g.f. Sum_{n >= 1, k >= 1} b_k(n)*x^n*y^k w.r.t. y and set y = 1. We get Sum_{n >= 1} d(n)*x^n = Sum_{d >= 1} phi(d) * A(x^d)/(1 - A(x^d)).
%C A308723 In our case, A(x) = x/(1 - x)^2, so Sum_{n >= 1} d(n)*x^n = -Sum_{d >=1} phi(d) * x^d/(1 - 3*x^d + x^(2*d)), which is exactly the g.f. of the current sequence that was proved in Gibson (2017) and Gibson et al. (2018).

%e A308723 We have a(1) = 1 because 1_1 is the only m-color cyclic composition of n = 1 and the total number of parts is 1.
%e A308723 We have a(2) = 4 because 2_1, 2_2, 1_1 + 1_1 are all the m-color cyclic compositions of 2 and the total number of parts is 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.
%e A308723 We have a(3) = 10 because 3_1, 3_2, 3_3, 1_1 + 2_1, 1_1 + 2_2, 1_1 + 1_1 + 1_1 are all the m-color cyclic compositions of n = 3 and the total number of parts is 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 10.

%N A343909 Number of generalized polyforms on the tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb with n cells.
%C A343909 This sequence counts "free" polyforms where holes are allowed. This means that two polyforms are considered the same if one is a rigid transformation (translation, rotation, reflection, or a combination thereof) of the other.

%N A383335 Length of shortest addition-multiplication-exponentiation chain for n.
%C A383335 An addition-multiplication-exponentiation chain for n is a finite sequence of numbers, starting with 1 and ending with n, in which each element except 1 equals x+y, x*y, or x^y for two preceding elements x and y (not necessarily distinct). The length of the chain is the number of elements in the chain, excluding 1.
%e A383335 a(248) = 5 because the shortest addition-multiplication-exponentiation chain for 248 has length 5: (1, 2, 3, 5, 243, 248).

%N A090053 Numbers divisible by the number formed when their digits are sorted in ascending order, excluding trivial cases.
%C A090053 Trivial cases are identified as (1) values of k where the digits are already in ascending order, like 123 or 2228, such that ASort(k)=k, or (2) values of k where k mod 10 = 0 and all digits other than trailing zeros are in ascending order, like 12000 or 333500, such that ASort(k)=k/10^z, where z = the number of trailing zeros of k. In case (1), k/ASort(k) is equivalent to k/k (as in 123/123). In case (2), k/ASort(k) is 10^z (as in 12000/12). Neither of these cases is very interesting.
%C A090053 Sequence A084687 is a subsequence of this sequence, but that sequence excludes any value of k with 1 or more zero digits.
%H A090053 C. Seggelin, <a href="http://www.plastereddragon.com/maths/asortdiv.htm">Numbers Divisible by Digit Permutations</a>.
%e A090053 a(1)=105 because the digits of 105 in ascending order are 015 and 105 is divisible by 15. a(24)=3105 because the digits of 3105 in ascending order are 135 and 3105 is divisible by 135.

%N A179745 Triangle read by rows, derived from iterates of operations in which a current eigensequence becomes the left border of a new triangle; with triangles of the form: all 1's except the left border for triangles >1.
%C A179745 Row sums of the triangle = odd-indexed Fibonacci numbers, A001519(n).
%C A179745 Eigensequences of successive triangles tend to A001519: (1, 2, 5, 13, 34, ...).
%F A179745 The triangle is derived from operations in two parts. First, form an array in which rows = eigensequences of triangles of the form: (all 1's except the left border). First triangle has all 1's. Eigensequence of this triangle = (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...). We shift this to the right = (1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...); creating a new triangle with this sequence as the left border. Eigensequence of this triangle = (1, 2, 5, 12, 28, 64, ...). We shift this to the right, making it the left border of the next triangle; and so on such that eigensequence of current triangle becomes next triangle's left border.
%F A179745 The second operation takes finite differences of the array. Reorienting the terms, we obtain the current triangle.
%e A179745 First few rows of the array:

%e A179745   1,  2,  5, 12, 28, 64, ...

%e A179745   1,  2,  5, 13, 34, 89, ...
%e A179745   ...
%e A179745 Taking finite differences from the top, we reorient the terms obtaining triangle:

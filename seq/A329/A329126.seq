%N A329126 a(n) is the least positive number which yields a multiple of n when its decimal digits (which are necessarily 0's and 1's) are read in any base.
%C A329126 a(n) might be called the "smallest trans-basic multiple of n."
%C A329126 In order to be a valid binary number, the terms may contain only 0's and 1's.
%C A329126 The number of 1's in a(n) is conjectured to be n; the number of 0's separating each one digit is usually A268336(n)-1 for small n. The number of trailing 0's is A051903(n).
%C A329126 The first 21 terms have been found and verified to be minimal via an advanced search; the 13th term (see b-file) contains 146 digits, and in general for every prime n the corresponding a(n) is conjectured to contain 2+(n-1)^2 0's and 1's.
%C A329126 A lower bound for a(n) is given by a(A032742(n)). Proof: If a(n) were smaller than a(A032742(n)), then a(A032742(n)) would not be the smallest trans-basic multiple of A032742(n); a(n) would be. By definition a(n) is the smallest trans-basic multiple of n, so we have a contradiction; QED.
%C A329126 To verify a trans-basic multiple of n for n > 2, one must only: A) make sure the string has some multiple of n of '1' digits; B) make sure the string ends with at least one '0' digit; and C) check that, for all prime bases below n, the resulting number is divisible by n. If these three conditions are met, the string is a trans-basic multiple of n.
%C A329126 While the formula given below is guaranteed to provide a trans-basic multiple of n, it does not always yield a(n) which by definition is the smallest such number. [Corrected by _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 14 2019]
%C A329126 From _N. J. A. Sloane_, Nov 12 2019: (Start)
%C A329126 For each n, the values of (string a(n) read in base b)/n for b = 1,2,3,... give a sequence of integers.
%C A329126 For n=1 this is the all-1's sequence A000012.
%C A329126 For n=2, a(2) = 110 which in base b is b+b^2. Divided by 2 we get (b+b^2)/2, which evaluated at b = 1,2,3,4,... is 1,3,6,10,..., the triangular numbers A000217.
%C A329126 For n=3, we get (b+b^3+b^5)/3, which is A220892.
%C A329126 For n=4, we get A328994. (End)

%F A329126 To generate an upper bound on a(n), start with n 1's (this is required to ensure that it is divisible by n in bases n+1, 2n+1, etc.)
%F A329126 Next, place A268336(n)-1 0's in between the 1's (this ensures that the powers that are added will always sum to 0 (mod n)).
%F A329126 Finally, add A051903(n) 0's on the right (this is to ensure that the number will be divisible by n in bases that are roots of factors of n).
%F A329126 Note that this formula does not always yield the minimal solution a(n). For instance, a(10) is obtained from the above result by grouping the 1's in pairs and separating the pairs by two 0's.
%F A329126 a(n) <= A329338(n), with equality except for n = 10, 14, 15, ... - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 14 2019

%N A084433 Numbers whose cyclic permutations have GCD > 1.
%C A084433 Following are members of this sequence: (1) Numbers made up of even digits (GCD >= 2). (2) Numbers divisible by 3 (GCD >= 3). (3) Multiples of 11 containing an even number of nonzero digits (GCD >= 11); (i) with highest common factor 11 e.g. 1243; (ii) with highest common factor > 11 e.g. 142857. (4) Numbers made up of identical digits >1 (GCD = the number itself).

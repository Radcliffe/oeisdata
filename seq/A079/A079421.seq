%e A079421 Terms are written in square boxes radiating spirally (cf. Ulam prime spiral). a(0)=0 and a(1)=1, so write 0 and then 1 to its right. a(2) goes in the box below a(1). The nearest two filled boxes contain a(0) and a(1), so a(2)=abs(a(0)-a(1))=abs(0-1)=1. a(3) goes in the box to the left of a(2). The nearest two filled boxes contain a(0) and a(2), so a(3)=abs(a(0)-a(2))=abs(0-1)=1.

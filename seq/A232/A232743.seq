%N A232743 Numbers n for which the largest m such that (m-1)! divides n is a composite number > 5.
%C A232743 Numbers n for which A055881(n)>4 and is one of the terms of A072668.
%C A232743 Numbers n for which two plus the number of the trailing zeros in their factorial base representation A007623(n) is a composite number larger than 5.
%C A232743 All terms are multiples of 120. Specifically, these are all those terms of A232742 which are divisible by 120 (or equally: 24).
%C A232743 Please see also the comments in A055926, whose subset this sequence is.

%e A232743 120 is included because A055881(120)=5 and 5+1 is a composite number larger than 5. Note that A007623(120) = '10000', with four trailing zeros.
%e A232743 720 is the first missing multiple of 120, as A055881(720)=6 and 7 is a prime, not composite, so 720 is not included in this sequence. Note that A007623(720) = '100000', with five trailing zeros, and 5+2 is not a composite.
%e A232743 120960 (= 3*8!) is included because A055881(120960)=8 and 9 is a composite number larger than 5. Note that A007623(120960) = '30000000', with seven trailing zeros.

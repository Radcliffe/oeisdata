%N A359563 Odd numbers that have at least two divisors with the same value of the Euler totient function (A000010).
%C A359563 The even numbers are excluded from this sequence since every even number has this property: it is divisible by 1 and 2, and phi(1) = phi(2) = 1.
%C A359563 If k is a term then all the odd multiples of k are terms. The primitive terms are in A359564.
%C A359563 The numbers of terms below 10^k, for k = 1, 2, ..., are 0, 1, 12, 140, 1402, 14193, 142606, 1427749, 14283236, 142855925, ... . Apparently, the asymptotic density of this sequence exists and equals 0.01428... .
%C A359563 The least term that is not divisible by 3 is a(26) = 2107.

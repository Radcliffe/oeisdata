%N A292766 Numbers n whose trajectory under iteration of the map k -> (sigma(k)+phi(k))/2 consists only of integers and is unbounded, excluding numbers n whose trajectory merges with the trajectory of a smaller number.
%C A292766 These are the "seeds" in A291790, that is, every number which blows up under iteration of the map k -> (sigma(k)+phi(k))/2 belongs to one of these trajectories. AT PRESENT ALL TERMS ARE CONJECTURAL.
%C A292766 The trajectories of these numbers are pairwise disjoint for the first 400 steps.
%C A292766 This is unsatisfactory because it is possible that, at some later step, these trajectories may merge, reach a prime (a fixed point), or reach a fraction (and die). However, this seems unlikely on probabilistic grounds - see the remarks of _Andrew R. Booker_ in A292108.
%C A292766 Normally such a sequence would not be included in the OEIS, but exceptions have been made for this and A291790 because a number of people have worked on them, and also in the hope that this will encourage resolution of some of the open questions.
%C A292766 Needs a b-file.

%N A246158 Odious reducible polynomials over GF(2), coded in binary. (Polynomials with an odd number of nonzero terms that are reducible over GF(2)).
%C A246158 Self-inverse permutation A193231 maps each term of this sequence to some term of A246156 and vice versa.
%C A246158 Each term belongs into a distinct infinite cycle in permutations like A246161/A246162 and A246163/A246164 apart from 4, which is in a finite cycle (3 4) of A246161/A246162 and 4 and 8 which both are in the same (infinite) cycle of A246163/A246164.

%e A246158 4, which is 100 in binary, encodes polynomial x^2, which factorizes as (x)(x) over GF(2), (4 = A048720(2,2)), thus it is reducible in that polynomial ring. It also has an odd number of nonzero terms present (equally: odd number of 1-bits in its code), in this case just one, thus 4 is a member of this sequence.

%N A367408 a(n) = n for n a power of 2; otherwise let 2^r be the greatest power of 2 which does not exceed n, then a(n) = the least novel m*a(k) where k = n - 2^r, and m is not a prior term.
%C A367408 Based on a recursion similar to that which produces the Doudna sequence, A005940, using the same definition of k, the "distance" from the greatest power of 2 less than n (compare with A365436).
%C A367408 Sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers, A000027.

%F A367408 a(2^k) = 2^k for all k >= 0.
%F A367408 a(2^k + 1) = m, the least unused term up to a(2^k), where multiples (other than 1) of m have been used to generate terms between a(2^(k-1)) and a(2^k) except for those which have occurred earlier; see Example.
%e A367408 a(3) = 3 since k = 1, a(1) = 1, and 3 is the smallest number which has not already occurred.
%e A367408 a(7) = 18, since k = 3, a(3) = 3, m = 6 is the least unused number and 18 has not already occurred.
%e A367408 For n = 18, k = 2, a(2) = 2, m = 9 is the least unused number, so we should expect a(18) = 2*9 = 18, but 18 has already occurred at a(7). Therefore we increment to m = 10, the next smallest unused number, and find a(18) = 20 (which has not occurred previously).

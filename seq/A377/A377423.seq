%N A377423 Distinct values of the number of integers between consecutive self numbers (A163139), in order of occurrence.
%C A377423 Each new value is typically found between self numbers located around 10^k, for some k.
%C A377423 This sequences exhibits interesting patterns, for instance, many new numbers are 13 apart.

%F A377423 a(n) = A377473(n)-1. - _Daniel Mondot_, Apr 17 2025
%e A377423 Between the first 2 self numbers 1 and 3, there is 1 integer. So 1 is in the sequence
%e A377423 The next new gap is between 9 and 20, with 10 integers, so 10 is in the sequence.
%e A377423 The next new gap is between 1006 and 1021, with 14 integers, so 14 is in the sequence.

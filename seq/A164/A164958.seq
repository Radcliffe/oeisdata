%N A164958 Primes p with the property that if p/3 is in the interval (p_m, p_(m+1)), where p_m>=3 and p_k is the k-th prime, then the interval (3p_m, p) contains a prime.
%C A164958 For k>1 (not necessarily integer), we call a Labos k-prime L_n^(k) the prime a_k(n) which is the smallest number such that pi(a_k(n)) - pi(a_k(n)/k)= n. Note that, the sequence of all primes corresponds to the case of "k=oo". Let p be a k-Labos prime, such that p/k is in the interval (p_m, p_(m+1)), where p_m>=3 and p_n is the n-th prime. Then the interval (k*p_(m), p) contains a prime. Conjecture. For every k>1 there exist non-k-Labos primes, which possess the latter property. For example, for k=2, the smallest such prime is 131. Problem. For every k>1 to estimate the smallest non-k-Labos prime, which possess the latter property. [From _Vladimir Shevelev_, Sep 02 2009]
%C A164958 All 3-Labos primes are in this sequence.
%e A164958 If p=61, the p/3 is in the interval (19, 23); we see that the interval (57, 61) contains a prime (59). Thus 61 is in the sequence.

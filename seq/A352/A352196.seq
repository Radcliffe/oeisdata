%N A352196 a(n) = number of steps for the standard mod-n Ackermann function to stabilize to a set consisting of only one value, or -1 if it does not stabilize.
%C A352196 This was Stan Wagon's Problem of the Week #1340, from March 2022, which in turn was based on a 1993 Monthly problem of Jon Froemke and Jerrold Grossman.
%C A352196 Stan Wagon mentions that Mark Rickert has found the first 8 million terms (see link), and the only one that does not stabilize is n = 1969 where it becomes periodic with period 2 after 8 steps. So a(1969) = -1.

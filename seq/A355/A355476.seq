%N A355476 a(1)=1. For a(n) a novel term, a(n+1) = A000005(a(n)). For a(n) seen already k > 1 times, a(n+1) = k*a(n).
%C A355476 1 is the only number to appear twice, since it has just one divisor.
%C A355476 Consequently 2 is the only prime whose first occurrence is a multiple of prior terms (2*1), all other occurrences of 2 being subsequent to a novel prime (including itself).
%C A355476 All composite numbers appear as multiples of prior terms, and also as the number of divisors of novel terms, whereas all odd prime terms are the result of novel (square) terms whose number of divisors is prime (A009087).
%C A355476 Conjectures: (i) Every integer > 1 appears infinitely many times. (ii) The first occurrences of primes appear in natural order, starting with 2 as described above, and continuing with odd primes a(n) = p, following a(n-1) = 2^(p-1).

%e A355476 a(1)=1 a novel term, so a(2)=d(1)=1, then a(3)=2+1=2.
%e A355476 a(15)=24, a novel term, therefore a(16)=d(24)=8, and since this is the second occurrence of 8 (a(10)=8), a(17)=2*8=16. Since 16 is a novel term with 5 divisors, a(18)=5, and so on.

%N A354075 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of distinct positive integers such that A(a(n+1)) is prime to A(a(n)) but not to A(a(n-1)), where A is A001414.
%C A354075 2,3,4 is the earliest string of three consecutive numbers which satisfy the definition, therefore the sequence begins a(1)=2, a(2)=3, a(3)=4.
%C A354075 Sequence is infinite since there always exists a k which has not occurred before such that A(k) is prime to A(a(n)) but not to A(a(n-1)). Since A001414 covers N/{1} a number m can be found such that A(m)=k. Thus k can be chosen for a(n+1) unless there is a smaller number with the same property.
%C A354075 Similar to the Yellowstone sequence (A098550) in terms of coprime relations.
%C A354075 The first seven primes are in natural order but then we have ...,17,23,19,31,37,43,41,47,29,...
%C A354075 Conjectured to be a permutation of N/{0,1}.

%e A354075 a(4)=14 because A(14)=9 is prime to A(a(3))=4 but not to A(a(2))=3, and is the smallest number not already seen in the sequence which has this property.

%S A066466 3,4,6,96,393216
%N A066466 Numbers having just one anti-divisor.
%C A066466 See A066272 for definition of anti-divisor.
%C A066466 Jon Perry calls these anti-primes.
%C A066466 From _Max Alekseyev_, Jul 23 2007; updated May 23 2023: (Start)
%C A066466 Except for a(2) = 4, the terms of A066466 have form 2^k*p where p is odd prime and both 2^(k+1)*p-1, 2^(k+1)*p+1 are prime (i.e., twin primes). In other words, this sequence, omitting 4, is a subsequence of A040040 containing elements of the form 2^k*p with prime p.
%C A066466 Furthermore, since 2^(k+1)*p-1, 2^(k+1)*p+1 must equal -1 and +1 modulo 3, the number 2^(k+1)*p must be 0 modulo 3, implying that p=3. Therefore every term, except 4, must be of the form 3*2^k such that 3*2^(k+1)-1, 3*2^(k+1)+1 are twin primes.
%C A066466 According to these tables: http://www.prothsearch.com/riesel1.html and http://www.prothsearch.com/riesel2.html there are no other such k up to 18*10^6. Therefore a(6) (if it exists) is greater than 3*2^(18*10^6) ~= 10^5418540. (End)

%C A066466 The 2 last known anti-primes seem to relate to the Fermat primes (coincidence?):
%C A066466 96 = 3 * 2^5 = 3 * 2^F_1 = 3 * 2^[2^(2^1) + 1] and
%C A066466 393216 = 3 * 2^17 = 3 * 2^F_2 = 3 * 2^[2^(2^2) + 1],
%C A066466 where F_k is the k-th Fermat prime. (End)

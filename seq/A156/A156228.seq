%N A156228 Number of lakes in Conway's Game of Life with 8*n cells.
%C A156228 a(n) is also the number of walks of length 4*n on a 2D lattice with the properties that: it turns 90 degrees after every step of length 1, it is a closed loop (i.e., it ends where it started) and it never crosses itself.
%C A156228 In A266549, the walks are allowed to continue straight ahead. - _Pontus von Br√∂mssen_, May 06 2025

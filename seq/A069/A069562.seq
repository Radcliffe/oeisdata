%N A069562 Numbers, m, whose odd part (largest odd divisor, A000265(m)) is a nontrivial square.
%C A069562 Previous name: sum(d|n,6d/(2+mu(d))) is odd, where mu(.) is the Moebius function, A008683.
%C A069562 From _Peter Munn_, Jul 06 2020: (Start)
%C A069562 Numbers that have an odd number of odd nonsquarefree divisors.
%C A069562 [Proof of equivalence to the name, where m denotes a positive integer:
%C A069562 (1) These properties are equivalent: (a) m has an even number of odd squarefree divisors; (b) m has a nontrivial odd part.
%C A069562 (2) These properties are equivalent: (a) m has an odd number of odd divisors; (b) the odd part of m is square.
%C A069562 (3) m satisfies the condition at the start of this comment if and only if (1)(a) and (2)(a) are both true or both false.
%C A069562 (4) The trivial odd part, 1, is a square, so (1)(b) and (2)(b) cannot both be false, which (from (1), (2)) means (1)(a) and (2)(a) cannot both be false.
%C A069562 (5) From (3), (4), m satisfies the condition at the start of this comment if and only if (1)(a) and (2)(a) are true.
%C A069562 (6) m satisfies the condition in the name if and only if (1)(b) and (2)(b) are true, which (from (1), (2)) is equivalent to (1)(a) and (2)(a) being true, and hence from (5), to m satisfying the condition at the start of this comment.]

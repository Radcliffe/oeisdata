%N A234741 a(n) is the base-2 carryless product of the prime factors of n; Encoding of the product of the polynomials over GF(2) represented by the prime factors of n (with multiplicity).
%C A234741 "Encoding" means the number whose binary representation is given by the coefficients of the polynomial, e.g., 13=1101[2] encodes X^3+X^2+1. The product is the usual multiplication of polynomials in GF(2)[X] (or binary multiplication without carry-bits, cf. A048720).
%C A234741 a(n) <= n. [As all terms of the table A061858 are nonnegative]

%F A234741 a(0)=0, a(1)=1, and for n > 1, a(n) = A048720(A020639(n),a(n/A020639(n))). [A048720 used as a bivariate function]
%F A234741 Equally, for n with its unique prime factorization n = p_1 * ... * p_k, with the p_i not necessarily distinct primes, a(n) = p_1 x ... x p_k, where x stands for carryless multiplication defined in A048720, which is isomorphic to multiplication in GF(2)[X].
%F A234741 a(2n) = 2*a(n).
%F A234741 More generally, if A061858(x,y) = 0, then a(x*y) = a(x)*a(y).
%F A234741 a(A235034(n)) = A235034(n).
%F A234741 A236378(n) = n - a(n).
%e A234741 a(9) = a(3*3) = 5, as when we multiply 3 ('11' in binary) with itself, and discard the carry-bits, using XOR (A003987) instead of normal addition, we get:
%e A234741    11
%e A234741   110
%e A234741 -----
%e A234741   101
%e A234741 that is, 5, as '101' is its binary representation. In other words, a(9) = a(3*3) = A048720(3,3) = 5.
%e A234741 Alternatively, 9 = 3*3, and 3=11[2] encodes the polynomial X+1, and (X+1)*(X+1) = X^2+1 in GF(2)[X], which is encoded as 101[2] = 5, therefore a(9) = 5. - _M. F. Hasler_, Feb 16 2014

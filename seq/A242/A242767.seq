%N A242767 Numbers of repetitions of terms in A242758.
%C A242767 If {p<q} is a pair of twin primes, then the number p+3=q+1 is in A242758. If this number occurs k times in A242758, then we say that k is the index of the pair of twin primes {p,q} with p in A001359.
%C A242767 Is this the same as A027833 shifted by two indices? - _R. J. Mathar_, May 23 2014

%F A242767 From the construction of A242758, in supposition of an infinity of twin primes, we have a(2)=1; for n>=3, a(n) = A027833(n-2). Otherwise, A027833 is finite, while A242758 will coincide with A242720 after the last pair of twin primes. - _Vladimir Shevelev_, May 26 2014

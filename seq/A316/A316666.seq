%N A316666 Number of simple relaxed compacted binary trees of right height at most one with no sequences on level 1 and no final sequences on level 0.
%C A316666 A relaxed compacted binary tree of size n is a directed acyclic graph consisting of a binary tree with n internal nodes, one leaf, and at most n pointers. It is constructed from a binary tree of size n, where the first leaf in a post-order traversal is kept and all other leaves are replaced by pointers. These links may point to any node that has already been visited by the post-order traversal. It is called simple if for nodes with two pointers both point to the same node. The right height is the maximal number of right-edges (or right children) on all paths from the root to any leaf after deleting all pointers. See the Wallner link.
%C A316666 a(n) is one of two "basis" sequences for sequences of the form a(0)=a, a(1)=b, a(n) = n*a(n-1) + (n-1)*a(n-2), the second basis sequence being A096654 (with 0 appended as a(0)). The sum of these sequences is listed as A000255. - _Gary Detlefs_, Dec 11 2018

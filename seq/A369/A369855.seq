%N A369855 a(n) is the smallest error in trying to solve n^5 = x^5 + y^5: for each n from 2 on, find positive integers x and y, x <= y < n such that |n^5 - x^5 - y^5| is minimal and let a(n) = n^5 - x^5 - y^5. In case of a tie, choose the solution with smallest y.
%C A369855 We must impose y < n to exclude the trivial solution x = 1, y = n, a(n) = -1.
%C A369855 There is no admissible pair (x, y) for n = 1, whence a(1) is undefined.
%C A369855 What is the first n for which we have two solutions (x, y) that yield the same minimal absolute difference but opposite signs for n^5 - x^5 - y^5?
%e A369855 For n = 2, the only admissible pair is (x, y) = (1, 1), which yields a(2) = n^5 - x^5 - y^5 = 30.
%e A369855 Similarly, for n = 3, 4, ..., 9 the minimum is reached for x = y = n - 1, which yields a(n) = n^5 - 2*(n-1)^5 = 179, 538, 1077, 1526, 1255, -846 and -6487, respectively.
%e A369855 For n = 10, the minimum is reached for x = 8, y = 9, which yields a(10) = 10^5 - 8^5 - 9^5 = 8183, smaller in absolute value than 10^5 - 2*9^5 = -18098.

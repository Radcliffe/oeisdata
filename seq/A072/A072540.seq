%N A072540 Numbers that are not differences between successive Ulam numbers (A002858).
%C A072540 Unfortunately, it appears that the entries are all conjectural. I am not aware of any proofs that the listed numbers can never appear. The terms shown are those listed by Pickover. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jun 19 2008
%C A072540 However, a gap of 35 doesn't occur until after the 35755308th term (483379914), so these missing gaps could eventually occur. - _Jud McCranie_, Jun 13 2008
%C A072540 The sequence is conjectured to continue: 23, 26, 28, 31, 33.  These gaps do not appear in the first 158000000 terms, so are candidates for the sequence. [_Jud McCranie_, Sep 12 2013]
%C A072540 The conjectured list of gaps that don't appear holds through the first 28 billion Ulam numbers. - _Jud McCranie_, Jan 07 2016

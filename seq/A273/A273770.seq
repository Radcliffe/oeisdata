%C A273770 The values for p are given in A273756 which is the main entry, see there for further information and (cross)references.
%C A273770 From the initial values, the sequence seems strictly decreasing, with a(n) = 40-n, however, this property does not persist beyond a(27) = 13.
%C A273770 The upper limit on p ensures that we have a well-defined sequence: The prime k-tuple conjecture predicts existence of arbitrarily long sequences of primes of the given form, and thus unbounded minimal value of x. However, the corresponding prime tuples are expected to appear for much larger values of p. The given limit should be understood as "below the first/next such prime tuple", and in general the values a(n) should not change if that limit would be increased by some orders of magnitude. There might be counterexamples, which would be interesting. The given limit was chosen for lack of a more natural expression, and is relatively small. It could be replaced by a more appropriate function of n if a proposal is available, which should not affect the values given so far. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jan 22 2018, edited Feb 17 2020

%N A319139 a(n) is the smallest position k >= 1 on the diagonal at which a record gap of size n between two adjacent Dyck paths of the symmetric representation of sigma starts.
%C A319139 This sequence of positions of record gaps on the diagonal is not increasing, in contrast to the apparently increasing sequence A279286 of record numbers of Dyck paths jointly crossing the diagonal.
%C A319139 For n >= 2 it appears that a(2*n) > a(2*n+1), however a(2*n) < a(2*n+2) is false as a(12) = 179669 and a(14) = 122268 show, just as a(2n-1) < a(2*n+1) is false as a(23) = 576404 and a(25) = 499557 show.
%C A319139 Additional values of this sequence: a(27) = 1152829, a(29) = 999115, a(31) = 1498678, a(33) = 2305659.
%F A319139 It appears that a(n) = A240542(A128605(n+1)-1) + 1.
%e A319139 A240542(119) = 81 and A240542(120) = A240542(A128605(4)) = 85 establish the starting position on the diagonal of the first gap of size 3 as 82 = a(3).
%e A319139 A240542(3484799) = 2415479 and A240542(3484800) = A240542(A128605(19)) = 2415498 establish the starting position on the diagonal of the first gap of size 18 as 2415480 = a(18).

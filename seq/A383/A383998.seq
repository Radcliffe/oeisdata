%N A383998 Number of distinct truncated Graham sequences (as in Graham's Tree Reconstruction Conjecture) of length 4 on trees of order n.
%C A383998 For small trees, the sequence |G|, |L(G)|, |L(L(G))|, |L(L(L(G)))| is sufficient to determine the tree, so this sequence has the same first few terms as A000055.

%e A383998 For n=7, there are 21 trees but only 20 distinct truncated Graham sequences of length 4. There are two trees on 7 vertices which have the same sequence [|G|, |L(G)|, |L(L(G))|, |L(L(L(G)))|].
%Y A383998 Cf. A000055.

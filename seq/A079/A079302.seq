%N A079302 a(n) = number of shortest addition chains for n that are non-Brauer chains.
%C A079302 In a general addition chain, each element > 1 is a sum of two previous elements (the two may be the same element). In a Brauer chain, each element > 1 is a sum of the immediately previous element and another previous element. Conversely, a non-Brauer chain has at least one element that is the sum of two elements earlier than the preceding one.

%e A079302 7 has five shortest addition chains: (1,2,3,4,7), (1,2,3,5,7), (1,2,3,6,7), (1,2,4,5,7), and (1,2,4,6,7). All of these are Brauer chains. Hence a(7) = 0.
%e A079302 13 has ten shortest addition chains: (1,2,3,5,8,13), (1,2,3,5,10,13), (1,2,3,6,7,13), (1,2,3,6,12,13), (1,2,4,5,9,13), (1,2,4,6,7,13), (1,2,4,6,12,13), (1,2,4,8,9,13), (1,2,4,8,12,13), and (1,2,4,5,8,13). Of these, only the last is non-Brauer. Hence a(13) = 1.
%e A079302 12509 has 28 shortest addition chains, all of which happen to be non-Brauer (in fact, it is the smallest natural number for which all shortest addition chains are non-Brauer). Hence a(12509) = A079300(12509) = 28.
%Y A079302 Cf. A079300, the total number of minimal addition chains.

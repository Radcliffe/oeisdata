%N A100909 Concatenate number of occurrences in n of each decimal digit from 0 to 9 and drop leading zeros.
%C A100909 n = 0 is normally represented as the single digit 0, so a(0) = 1000000000. This representation system is inherently ambiguous by disregarding the order of n's digits but without modification will correctly identify those digits for all numbers up to 999999999 decimal; i.e., a(999999999) = 9; and for many beyond (e.g., a(121212121212121212) = a(111222111222222111) = ... = 990000000). However, for any n in which more than 9 of any single digit occur, additional ambiguity is introduced unless some type of grouping is also used (say, parentheses around or bars over a group of consecutive digits when written) so that, for example, (10) is known to represent 9999999999 rather than 8.

%e A100909 a(12) = 110000000 as 12 consists only of one 1 and one 2, hence the following are concatenated: 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 and dropping the leading 0 gives 110000000 (= a(21) also).

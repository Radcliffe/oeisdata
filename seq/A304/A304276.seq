%N A304276 Numbers equal to the sum of their aliquot parts, each of them increased by 2.
%C A304276 From _Giovanni Resta_, May 11 2018: (Start)
%C A304276 If p = 2^(1+t) + (1+2*t)*k - 1 is a prime, for some t > 0 and k even, then x = 2^t*p is in the sequence where k is the value by which the sum of aliquot parts is increased.
%C A304276 In this sequence k = 2; for t = 21 we get 8796271280128 which is a term greater than 2139136, but this does not exclude the existence of other intermediate terms following a different solution pattern. (End)
%C A304276 Terms using odd values of k seem very hard to find. Up to n = 10^12, only three such terms are known: 2, 98, and 8450, for k = 1, 5, and -7, respectively.
%e A304276 Aliquot part of 3 is 1 and 1+2 = 3.
%e A304276 Aliquot parts of 15 are 1, 3, 5 and (1+2) + (3+2) + (5+2) = 15.

%N A219782 Number of ways to write n=x+y (0<x<=y) with n^2-xy and n^2+xy both prime.
%C A219782 Conjecture: a(n)>0 if n is not among 1, 8, 10, 18, 20, 41, 46, 58, 78, 116, 440.
%C A219782 Zhi-Wei Sun also made the following general conjecture:
%C A219782 For any k=0,1,2,4,5,6,... and positive odd integer m, each sufficiently large integer n can be written as x+y (0<x<=y) with |m*n^k-xy| and |m*n^k+xy| all prime.
%C A219782 For example, if n>6 is different from 24 then n can be written as x+y with x,y positive, and xy-n and xy+n both prime; if n>308 then n can be written as x+y with x,y positive, and 3n^2-xy and 3n^2+xy both prime.

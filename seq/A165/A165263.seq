%N A165263 A sequence similar to the Fibonacci rabbit sequence for the Padovan sequence.
%C A165263 Starting with 0,1 and using the maps 0->1 1->.10 and 10->01 Gives the subsequences 0,1,10,01,1.10,10.01,01.1.10,1.10.10.01 etc. The n-th subsequence has a 1 count equal to P(n) where P is the n-th Padovan sequence number (A000931) and a digit length P(n+2). This sequence represents the binary number formed by concatenating these sebsequences. Similar to how the Fibonacci rabbit constant is formed by the maps 0->1 1->10.

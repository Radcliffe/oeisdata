%N A172248 Numbers k such that there do not exist two ways of writing k = a+b with a<=b, gcd(k,a,b)=1, and the same value of N(a,b,k) = product of distinct prime divisors of a*b*k.
%C A172248 Number of partitions k as sum a + b such that a<=b and gcd(a,b,k)=1 is given in A023022.
%C A172248 Number of partitions having distinct values of N(a,b,k) is given in A172245.
%C A172248 Number of partitions having the same values of N(a,b,k) is given in A172247.
%C A172248 Numbers k for which all partitions have different value of N(a,b,k) are given in A172248.
%e A172248 7 doesn't belong to this sequence because for 7 we have two partitions 7=1+6 and 7=3+4 with that same values of N(a,b,k) respectively 1*2*3*7=42 and 2*3*7=42.

%N A078668 Primes that are the difference between two powers: y^z - x^z = prime.
%C A078668 This sequence is much faster to compute than y^z+x^z since the occurrence of a prime for y^z - x^z only takes place when z = 1 or y-x = 1. This is true because y-x or y+x divides y^z - x^z. Comment out the print(x" "y" "z" "v" "ct); in the script to avoid listing the detail to the screen. Sum of the reciprocals of Seq(20,130) converges to 1.6359026039776143431548856889889230600448729878668090784647536941979 31129745142466816093140975967179... to 100 places.
%C A078668 Is this sequence well-defined? The data could not be reproduced based on the name, comments, or existing code. Note that all odd primes can be represented as the difference of two squares so, for example, why is 67 = 34^2-33^2 not in the data. Restricting z>2, also does not reproduce this sequence. - _Sean A.

%F A078668 Seq(n, m) = y^z - x^z = p. x=1..n, y=x..n, p=1..m. Include if p is prime.
%e A078668 919 = 18^3 - 17^3. 919 is prime.

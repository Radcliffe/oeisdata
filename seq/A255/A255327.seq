%N A255327 a(n) = 0 if n is in the infinite trunk of "number-of-runs beanstalk" (one of the terms of A255056), otherwise number of nodes (including leaves and the node n itself) in that finite subtree of the beanstalk.
%C A255327 The edge-relation between nodes is given by A236840(child) = parent. a(n) = 1 + the size of transitive closure of all children emanating from the parent at n. For any n in A255056 this would be infinite, thus such n are marked with zeros.
%C A255327 Odd numbers are leaves, as there are no such k that A236840(k) were odd, thus a(2n+1) = 1.

%N A243058 Fixed points of A243057 and A243059.
%C A243058 Number n is present if its prime factorization n = p_a * p_b * p_c * ... * p_i * p_j * p_k (where a <= b <= c <= ... <= i <= j <= k are the indices of prime factors, not necessarily all distinct; sorted into nondescending order) satisfies the condition that the first differences of those prime indices (a-0, b-a, c-b, ..., j-i, k-j) form a palindrome.
%C A243058 The above condition implies that none of the terms of A070003 are present, as then at least the difference k-j would be zero, but on the other hand, a-0 is at least 1. Cf. also A243068.

%e A243058 12 = 2*2*3 = p_1 * p_1 * p_2 is present, as the first differences (deltas) of the indices of its nondistinct prime factors (1-0, 1-1, 2-1) = (1,0,1) form a palindrome.
%e A243058 18 = 2*3*3 = p_1 * p_2 * p_2 is NOT present, as the deltas of the indices of its nondistinct prime factors (1-0, 2-1, 2-2) = (1,1,0) do NOT form a palindrome.
%e A243058 65 = 5*13 = p_3 * p_6 is present, as the deltas of the indices of its nondistinct prime factors (3-0, 6-3) = (3,3) form a palindrome.

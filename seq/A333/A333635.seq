%N A333635 Numbers m such that m^2 + 1 has at most 2 prime factors.
%C A333635 Equivalently, numbers m such that m^2 + 1 is prime or semiprime.
%C A333635 Henryk Iwaniec proved in 1978 that this sequence is infinite (see link). By contrast, it is not known whether there are infinitely many primes of the form m^2 + 1 (or infinitely many semiprimes of that form).
%C A333635 The integers that have at most 2 prime factors counted with multiplicity are called almost-primes of order 2 and they are in A037143. Here, as m^2 + 1 is not a square for m > 0, all the semiprimes of this form have two distinct prime factors (A144255), and with the primes of the form m^2 + 1 (A002496), they constitute A248742.

%e A333635 10^2 + 1 = 101, which is prime, so 10 is in the sequence.
%e A333635 11^2 + 1 = 122 = 2 * 61, so 11 is in the sequence.
%e A333635 12^2 + 1 = 145 = 5 * 29, so 12 is in the sequence.

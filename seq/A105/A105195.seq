%N A105195 Length of shortest simple Lucas chain for n.
%C A105195 Lucas chains are addition chains with additional requirements on the presence of differences between members of the chain.
%C A105195 (i) a(4) is given as 2 in Table 5.1 of the reference, which probably is a typographical error since the length of the example obviously is the same as for a(5).
%C A105195 (ii) Other authors call a(n)+1 the length of the chain, i.e., they include the first 1 of the chain in the count. - _R. J. Mathar_, May 24 2008

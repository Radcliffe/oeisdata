%N A383743 a(n) is the smallest prime not yet in the sequence that satisfies the following: for some pair of different digits i and j in a(n-1), i preceding j (from left to right), j precedes i in a(n). Leading 0s are not allowed; a(1)=13. See Comments for details.
%C A383743 To obtain a(n), the digits i and j in a(n-1) are chosen among all possible pairs of different digits in a(n-1) so that they produce the smallest prime not yet in the sequence according to the precedence requirement in the definition.  Naturally, to obtain a(n+1), the process is repeated but now a different pair of digits k, l in a(n) may be chosen to produce a(n+1).
%C A383743 Note that it is enough that there exists a pair of digits i and j in a(n) that satisfy the precedence requirement; not every pair of such digits must satisfy the requirement in the case of multiple occurrences of such digits in a(n) (see examples).

%e A383743 In a(2)=31 3 precedes 1, hence a(3)=103 since it is the smallest prime not yet in the sequence in which the digit 1 precedes 3.
%e A383743 In a(3)=103 1 precedes 0, hence a(4)=101 since it is the smallest prime not yet in the sequence in which the digit 0 precedes 1 (last two digits).
%e A383743 In a(10)=211 2 precedes 1, hence a(11)=1021 since it is the smallest prime not yet in the sequence in which the digit 1 precedes 2 (first and third digits).
%e A383743 In a(11)=1021 0 precedes 1 (second and fourth digits), hence a(12)=109 since it is the smallest prime not yet in the sequence in which the digit 1 precedes 0 (first and second digits).

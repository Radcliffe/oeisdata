%e A235045 In the following examples, X stands for the carryless multiplication of GF(2)[X] polynomials (A048720):
%e A235045 3 is a member, because it is in A091206, thus by definition fixed by A235041/A235042.
%e A235045 41 is a member for the same reason.
%e A235045 123 is a member, because 123 = 3*41, thus A235041(123) = A235041(3) X A235041(41) = 3 X 41 = A048720(3,41) = 123. That is, we happen to get the same result back as 3, '11' in binary, and 41, '101001' in binary, can be multiplied together to 123, '1111011' in binary, without producing any carries.
%e A235045 135 is a member, because 135 = 3*3*3*5, thus A235041(135) = A235041(3) X A235041(3) X A235041(3) X A235041(5) = 3 X 3 X 3 X 25 = 15 X 25 = 135.

%Y A235045 The sequence differs from its subsequence A235032 for the first time at n=54, where a(54)=135, while A235032(54)=137.
%Y A235045 A091206 gives the prime terms.

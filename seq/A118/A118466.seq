%N A118466 Numbers k such that k^2+k+1 is abundant.
%C A118466 19581212842 was discovered by _Martin Fuller_, Dec 06 2007 and proved to the smallest term by _Jack Brennen_, Dec 07 2007 (see link below)
%C A118466 139136064116422 is also a term. - _Dean Hickerson_, Dec 06 2007
%C A118466 In contrast, it seems to be easier to find numbers n such that n^3+n+1 is abundant. The smallest solution is n=12210244 and there are 19 further solutions up through n=271870216. - _Hans Havermann_, Dec 05 2007. See A133373.
%C A118466 I found the first 2331 odd primitive abundant numbers A with no prime factors -1 mod 6, then looked for k*A-1 such that floor(sqrt(k*A-1))*(floor(sqrt(k*A-1))+1) = k*A-1, where k = 103 to 18000001. The first k found was 4447 for A(2331) = 3*7^2*13*19*31*37*43*61*79*97*103 which gives a(1) = 19581212842 = floor(sqrt(4447*A(2331)-1)); the second k found was 17744401 = 379*46819 for A(2221) = 3*7^4+13*19*31*37*43*61*67*73 which gives a(2) = 681577964785. No solution primitive abundant numbers were found with prime factors -1 mod 6 in the range I considered. - _Pierre CAMI_, Jan 11 2008
%C A118466 The sequence has positive lower density since 584890334898484251k + 139136064116422 is a term for all k. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Jan 24 2025

%e A118466 For n=19581212842, n^2+n+1 = 3*7^2*13*19*31*37*43*61*79*97*103*4447, sigma(n^2+n+1)/(n^2+n+1) = 2.0031147...
%e A118466 681577964785^2+681577964785+1 = 3*7^4*13*19*31*37*43*61*67*73*379*46819; 3*7^4*13*19*31*37*43*61*67*73 is a primitive abundant number so a(2) is an abundant number
%e A118466 5625634605028^2+5625634605028+1 = 3*7*7*7*13*19*19*31*37*43*61*67*73*919*484621. Note that 3*7*7*7*13*19*19*31*37*43*61*67*73 = A136607(17).

%N A124886 3-almost prime triangle, read by rows.
%C A124886 This is to 3-almost primes (A014612) as A124883 is to semiprimes (A001358). The n-th row is of length n. Each value is the smallest previously unused natural number such that every pair of adjacent values in the triangle is 3-almost prime (A014612). Consider row 2. Starting with T(1,2) = 1, the least integer we can add to 1 and get a 3-almost prime is 7, since 1 + 8 = 8 = 2^3 is 3-almost prime. Consider row 3. Starting with T(1,3) = 1, the least integer we can add to 1 and get a 3-almost prime is 7, but we've already used that. The least unused integer that works is 11, since 1 + 11 = 12 = 2^2 * 3 is 3-almost prime. If we cross out ones from the triangle read by rows, what remains is a permutation of the natural number greater than 1. That is, every nonnegative integer appears in the triangle. The second column T(n,2) is monotone increasing.

%F A124886 T(n,1) = 1 for all natural numbers n. For n>1 and 1<k<n we have T(n,k) = min{j such that j<>T(n,i) for i<k and j<>T(r,s) for r<n and for all i<j we have T(i,j) + T(i,j-1) is in A014612}.

%N A090061 Numbers n divisible by exactly two nontrivial permutations (rearrangements) of the digits of n, excluding all permutations that result in digit loss.
%C A090061 Trivial permutations are identified as those where the permutation = n itself. Digit loss occurs when a permutation has 0 in the most significant position, which drops off, leaving a number with fewer digits. For example, when n is 3105, the permutation 0315 is excluded because 315 has fewer digits than 3105.
%C A090061 In the first million values of n, there is only one term that is divisible by three lossless nontrivial permutations. That term is 857142 which is divisible by 142857, 285714 and 428571. Note that 857142 is equal to floor((6/7)*10^6).
%H A090061 C. Seggelin, <a href="http://www.plastereddragon.com/maths/asortdiv.htm">Numbers Divisible by Digit Permutations</a>.
%e A090061 a(4)=923076 because 923076 is divisible by both 230769 and 307692, two nontrivial permutations of 923076 with the same number of digits.

%N A085152 All prime factors of n and n+1 are <= 5. (Related to the abc conjecture.)
%C A085152 Equivalently: Numbers n such that n(n+1) is 5-smooth.
%C A085152 The ABC conjecture would imply that if the prime factors of A, B, C are prescribed in advance, then there is only a finite number of solutions to the equation A + B = C with gcd(A,B,C)=1 (indeed it would bound C to be no more than "roughly" the product of those primes). So in particular there ought to be only finitely many pairs of adjacent integers whose prime factors are limited to {2, 3, 5} (D. Rusin).
%C A085152 This sequence is complete by a theorem of Stormer. See A002071. - _T. D. Noe_, Mar 03 2008
%C A085152 This is the 3rd row of the table A138180. It has 10 = A002071(3) = A145604(1)+A145604(2)+A145604(3) terms and ends with A002072(3) = 80. It is the union of all terms in rows 1 through 3 of the table A145605. It is a subsequence of A252494 and A085153. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jan 16 2015

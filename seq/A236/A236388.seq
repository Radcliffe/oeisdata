%N A236388 Primes in order of first appearance among the prime factors of p+1 where p is a prime.
%C A236388 The first p+1 (p prime) is 2+1=3, so 3 is the first term of the sequence. The next is 3+1=4=2*2, and the prime 2 appears next, so it is the second term of the sequence. The next p+1 = 5+1 = 6 gives no new prime factor; neither do 7+1 = 8 and 11+1 = 12. 13+1 = 14 = 2*7 gives the new prime factor 7, so 7 is the third term of the sequence.
%C A236388 If "p+1" is changed to "p-1" we get A112037. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 24 2014

%N A101050 Least k such that prime(n)*2^k-1 is prime, or -1 if no such k exists.
%C A101050 Primes p such that p*2^k-1 is composite for all k are called Riesel numbers. The smallest known Riesel number is the prime 509203. Currently, 2293 is the smallest prime whose status is unknown. For a(120), which corresponds to the prime 659, Dave Linton found the least k is 800516. - _T. D. Noe_, Aug 04 2005

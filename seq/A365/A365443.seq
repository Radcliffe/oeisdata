%N A365443 Triangle read by rows: T(n,s) is the numerator of the probability that the sum s occurs when repeated rolls of an n-sided die are summed for s = 0..2n.
%C A365443 The triangle is formed by considering the probability of occurrence of a zero-indexed sum, s, of repeated rolls of an n-sided die. The probability is obtained by considering that the sum s = 0 appears with probability 1, and then for every s > 0, the sum s has a probability of appearing that is 1/n times the sum of the probability of appearing of each of the previous n values of s. The denominator of this probability is n^s, and the numerator is given in the rows of the triangle below.
%C A365443 For example, consider repeated rolls of an n=4-sided die. Looking at the corresponding portion of the sequence (i.e., 1, 1, 3, 5, 11), the probability that s = 0 occurs is 1/1, the probability that s = 1 occurs is 1/(n^s) = 1/4, the probability that s = 2 occurs is 5/(n^s) = 5/16, as there is a 1/4 chance that it is rolled from the start plus the 1/16 chance that it occurs when two consecutive 1's are rolled, and so on. Hence the probability for all s <= n numbers that can be rolled is (n+1)^(s-1)/n^s, with a global maximum at s = n.
%C A365443 However, for s > n, where there is no longer the chance that the sum occurs in a single roll, the fraction drops precipitously. It then resumes rising until s = floor((n+1)^(n+1)/n^n - n) (see A366451) which is the s having the maximum probability for s > n. Therefore this maximum will always occur at s <= 2n for all nontrivial dice (i.e., dice with n > 1 sides). Hence the rows of this triangle have been terminated at 2n since that guarantees the maximum, but a row could in principle be extended in perpetuity, wherein the fraction would stabilize about the value 2/(n+1).

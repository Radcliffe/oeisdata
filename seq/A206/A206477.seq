%N A206477 (Number of permutations of {1,2,...,n} for which sums of three consecutive numbers (with wraparound) are all distinct)/2n.
%C A206477 Essentially different ways 1,2,...,n can be placed around a circle so that sums of three consecutive numbers are distinct.
%e A206477 a(4)=3 because up to rotation/reflection the only three permutations which work are 1234, 1243, and 1324

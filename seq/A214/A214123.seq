%N A214123 Smallest positive k such that n+k(n-1) is prime.
%C A214123 Given n fenceposts, what is the minimum (but greater than zero) number of new posts which can be inserted between each consecutive pair of original posts to obtain a prime number of total posts?
%C A214123 Where the minimum is allowed to be zero, substitute a(n) = 0 for prime n.
%C A214123 a(n) is 1 when 2n-1 is prime, which is equivalent to a((p+1)/2)=1 for prime p > 2, therefore there are an infinite number of pairs of consecutive 1s in the sequence if the twin prime conjecture is true.

%e A214123 For n = 5, we have fenceposts like so: ||||| . To insert 1 post between each pair of original posts would leave us with 9 posts: |;|;|;|;|, which is not prime. Inserting two: |;;|;;|;;|;;| gives 13 posts. This is prime so a(5) = 2.

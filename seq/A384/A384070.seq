%N A384070 Number of connected components of n faces of the rhombicuboctahedron up to the 48 rotations and reflections of the rhombicuboctahedron.
%C A384070 Two faces are connected if they share an edge.
%C A384070 These are "free" polyforms because both rotations and reflections are allowed.
%C A384070 The rhombicuboctahedron is the polyhedral dual of the deltoidal icositetrahedron.

%H A384070 Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombicuboctahedron">Rhombicuboctahedron</a>
%e A384070 a(1) = 3 because the rhombicuboctahedron is not face-transitive but has three distinct types of faces: triangular faces, square faces that are connected to a triangular face, and square faces that are not connected to a triangular face.
%Y A384070 Cf. A383804 (deltoidal icositetrahedron).
%Y A384070 Cf. A384067 (cuboctahedron), A384068 (truncated cube), A384069 (truncated octahedron), A384070 (rhombicuboctahedron), A384071 (truncated cuboctahedron), A384072 (snub cube).

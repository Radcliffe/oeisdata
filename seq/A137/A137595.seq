%N A137595 Integers k such that the run lengths of identical digits in their binary expansion are palindromic after the rightmost bit is duplicated.
%C A137595 Decimal-binary representations of palindromic continued fractions.
%C A137595 Using the conversion rules, the first 14 fractions in the Stern-Brocot infinite Farey tree, (rational fractions k, 0 < k < 1) with palindromic continued fraction representations are: 1/2, 1/3, 2/5, 1/4, 3/8, 1/5, 5/12, 5/13, 3/10, 1/6, 7/16, 8/21, 4/15, 1/7.
%C A137595 In other words, this sequence encodes the positive fractions less than 1 with palindromic continued fractions by the order that they appear in the Stern-Brocot infinite Farey tree. The terms of the continued fraction [0; c1, c2, ..., cN] are encoded in the run lengths of the binary digits of k. However, the last term in a continued fraction is always greater than 1, so instead of encoding cN, we encode cN-1. - _Dominic McCarty_, Mar 04 2025

%e A137595 26 in binary is 11010. Appending a duplicate of the rightmost digit, 0, to the right gives 110100. The run lengths of consecutive identical binary digits is 2,1,1,2, which is a palindrome, so 26 is in the sequence.
%e A137595 The fraction corresponding to the encoded continued fraction [0;2,1,1,2] is 5/13.

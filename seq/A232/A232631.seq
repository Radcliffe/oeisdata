%N A232631 Coefficient table for minimal polynomials of s(2*l)^2 = (2*sin(Pi/(2*l)))^2.
%C A232631 The length of row l of this table is delta(l) + 1 = A055034(l) + 1, l >= 1, that is: 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6, 5, 7, 7, 5, ...
%C A232631 s(n):= 2*sin(Pi/n) is the length ratio side/R of a regular n-gon inscribed in a circle of radius R (in some length units). In general s(n)^2 = 4 - rho(n)^2 with rho(n):= 2*cos(Pi/n), the length ratio (smallest diagonal)/s(n) in the regular n-gon (n>=2). If n is even, say 2*l, l>=1, then s(2*l)^2 = 2 - rho(l) (because rho(2*l)^2 = rho(l) + 2). Therefore s(2*l) is an integer in the algebraic number field Q(rho(l)).
%C A232631 Its (monic) minimal polynomial is obtained from the conjugates of rho(l), called rho(l;j), j = 1, 2, ..., delta(l), which are the zeros of the minimal polynomial of rho(l) = rho(l;1) of degree delta(l) = A055034(l), called C(l, x) in A187360. These conjugates are therefore rho(l;j) = 2*cos(Pi*rpnodd(l,j)/l) where rpnodd(l,j) is the j-th entry of the list rpnodd(l) of the odd numbers < l which are relatively prime to l (for example, rpnodd(9) = [1,5,7], and  rpnodd(9,2) = 5). From this the conjugates of s(2*l)^2 become 2 - rho(l;j), and the minimal polynomial of s(2*l)^2 is MPs2(l, x) = product( x - (2- rho(l;j)), j=1..delta(l)) for l >=1. Because the zeros of C(l, x) are integers in the algebraic number field Q(rho(l)) written in its power basis (see table 4 of the link under A187360 to the Q(2 cos(Pi/n)) paper) one finds, after expansion and reducing powers of rho(l) modulo C(l, rho(l)), directly the integer coefficients appropriate for this (monic) minimal polynomial. Only the equation C(l, rho(l)) = 0 is needed, not the trigonometric version of rho(l) and its powers.
%C A232631 This computation was motivated by a preprint of S. Mustonen, P. Haukkanen and J. K. Merikoski, called 'Polynomials associated with squared diagonals of regular polygons', Nov 16 2013.

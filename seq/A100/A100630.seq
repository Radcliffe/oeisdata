%N A100630 Array read by antidiagonals: T(m,n) = Sum(1<=i<=m) [ i*(n-1+i)! ].
%C A100630 Inversion vector corresponding to T(m,n): ( n zeros , 1,2,3,...,m , zeros... )
%C A100630 These are the numbers of permutations (in reverse colexicographical order, compare A055089) that reverse a set of consecutive elements and leave all other elements unchanged. Permutation A(m,n) reverses all elements from n to m+n.
%C A100630 The former title of this sequence refers to finite tables of permutations in lexicographical order: "Triangle read by rows: row n gives the index number in the tables of permutations of order n+1, n+2, ... of the permutation in which the first n items are reversed and the remaining items are in order."

%e A100630 T(3,2) = Sum( 1 <= i <= 3 ) [ i * (1+i)! ]
%e A100630 = 1*(1+1)! + 2*(1+2)! + 3*(1+3)!

%o A100630 MATLAB code is shown on the Wikiversity page.
%o A100630 Using Iverson's J language, A. p for a permutation p gives the row number in the table of permutations of order (length of p) which has p as its value. For example, q 0 4 9 6 7 5 1 11 8 10 2 3 A. q 13610272.

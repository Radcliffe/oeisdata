%N A140748 a(n) is the number of divisors of n that are not coprime to the next larger divisor of n.

%F A140748 A140747(n) + a(n) = A000005(n) - 1.
%e A140748 The divisors of 20 are 1,2,4,5,10,20. 1 is coprime to 2. 2 is not coprime to 4. 4 is coprime to 5. 5 is not coprime to 10. And 10 is not coprime to 20. So there are 3 divisors, 2, 5 and 10, that are each not coprime to the next higher divisor. So a(20) = 3.

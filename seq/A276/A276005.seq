%N A276005 Numbers with hit-free factorial base representations; positions of zeros in A276004 & A276007.
%C A276005 We say there is a "hit" in factorial base representation (A007623) of n when there is any such pair of nonzero digits d_i and d_j in positions i > j so that (i - d_i) = j. Here the rightmost (least significant digit) occurs at position 1. This sequence gives all "hit-free" numbers, meaning that for every nonzero digit d_i (in position i) in their factorial base representation the digit at the position (i - d_i) is 0.
%C A276005 Also numbers n for which A060502(n) = A060128(n), in other words, the numbers n for which the number of slopes in their factorial base representation (A007623) is equal to the number of non-singleton cycles of the permutation listed as n-th permutation in the list A060117 (or A060118).
%C A276005 This can be viewed as a factorial base analog of base-2 related A003714.

%F A276005 Other identities. For all n >= 1:
%F A276005 a(A000110(n)) = n! = A000142(n). [To be proved.]
%e A276005 n=14 (factorial base "210") is included because 2 occurs in position 3 and 1 occurs in position 2, thus as (3-2) = 1 <> 2, 2 does not "hit" digit 1.
%e A276005 n=15 ("211") is NOT included because 2 occurring in position 3 hits the rightmost 1 in position 1 (as 3-2 = 1), and moreover, also the middle 1 hits the rightmost 1 as 2-1 = 1.

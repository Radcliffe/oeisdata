%N A009287 a(1) = 3; thereafter a(n+1) = least k with a(n) divisors.
%C A009287 The sequence must start with 3, since a(1)=1 or a(1)=2 would lead to a constant sequence. - _M. F. Hasler_, Sep 02 2008
%C A009287 The calculation of a(7) and a(8) is based upon the method in A037019 (which, apparently, is the method previously used by the authors of A009287). So a(7) and a(8) are correct unless n=a(6)=5040 or n=a(7)=293318625600 are "exceptional" as described in A037019. - _Rick L. Shepherd_, Aug 17 2006
%C A009287 a(7) is correct because 5040 is not exceptional (see A072066). - _T. D. Noe_, Sep 02 2008
%C A009287 Terms from a(2) to a(7) are highly composite (that is, found in A002182), but a(8) is not. - _Ivan Neretin_, Mar 28 2015 [Equivalently, the first 6 terms are in A002183, but a(7) is not. Note that the smallest number with at least a(7) divisors is A002182(695) ~ 1.77 * 10^59 with 293534171136 divisors, which is much smaller than a(8) ~ 6.70 * 10^75. - _Jianing Song_, Jul 15 2021]
%C A009287 Grime reported that Ramanujan unfortunately missed a(7) with 5040 divisors. - _Frank Ellermann_, Mar 12 2020
%C A009287 It is possible to prepend 2 to this sequence as follows. a(0) = 2; for n > 0, a(n) = the smallest natural number greater than a(n-1) with a(n-1) divisors. - _Hal M. Switkay_, Jul 03 2022

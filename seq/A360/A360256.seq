%N A360256 Number of ways to tile an n X n square using rectangles with distinct height X width dimensions.
%C A360256 All possible tilings are counted, including those identical by symmetry. Note that distinct height X width dimensions means that, for example, a 1 X 3 rectangle can be used twice, once in a horizontal (1 X 3) and once in a vertical (3 X 1) direction.
%e A360256 a(1) = 1 as the only way to tile a 1 X 1 square is with a square with dimensions 1 X 1.
%e A360256 a(2) = 1 as the only way to tile a 2 X 2 square is with a square with dimensions 2 X 2.
%e A360256 a(3) = 33. The possible tilings, excluding those equivalent by symmetry, are:

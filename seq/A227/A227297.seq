%N A227297 Suppose that (m, m+1) is a pair of consecutive powerful numbers as defined by A001694. This sequence gives the values of m for which neither m nor m+1 are perfect squares.
%C A227297 a(1) to a(5) were found by Jaroslaw Wroblewski, who also proved that this sequence is infinite (see link to Problem 53 below). However, there are no more terms less than 500^6 = 1.5625*10^16.
%C A227297 A subsequence of A060355 and of A001694.

%e A227297 12167 is a term because (12167, 12168) are a pair of consecutive powerful numbers, neither of which are perfect squares.
%e A227297 235224 is not a term because although (235224, 235225) are a pair of consecutive powerful numbers, the larger member of the pair is a square number (= 485^2).
%Y A227297 Cf. A060355, A001694.

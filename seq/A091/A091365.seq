%N A091365 Primes p such that the sum of the digits of p is not prime, but the sum of the cubes of the digits of p is prime.
%C A091365 Apparently if the cubes of the digits of a prime sum to a prime, it is more likely that the digits themselves also sum to a prime. In the first 10,000 primes there are 1969 primes p such that the cubes of the digits of p sum to a prime. Of these, only 358 are such that the sums of the digits are not prime. Interestingly, all of these primes have a digit sum of 25 or 35. Essentially this sequence is the terms of A091366 (primes whose digits cubed sum to a prime) that do not also appear in A046704 (primes whose digits sum to a prime).

%e A091365 a(1)=997 because 9+9+7 = 25 which is not prime, but 9^3+9^3+7^3 = 1801 which is prime.

%N A383300 Numbers k such that primorial base expansion of k has the primorial base expansion of k' as its suffix, where k' stands for the arithmetic derivative of k (A003415).

%e A383300 0 is a term as A003415(0) = 0.
%e A383300 1 is a term as A003415(1) = 0, whose primorial base expansion is here understood as an empty sequence of digits, thus it is a suffix of A049345(1) = 1.
%e A383300 3, like all odd primes, is a term as A003415(3) = 1, with A049345(3) = 11 and A049345(1) = 1.
%e A383300 4 and 27 are terms as they are in A051674 (the nonzero fixed points of A003415).
%e A383300 4784261 is a term as A003415(4784261) = 189671, with A049345(4784261) = 96411121 and A049345(189671) = 6411121. 4784261 is the first term > 1 of this sequence that is not in A348283. See more examples in A383301.

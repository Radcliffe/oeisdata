%N A226251 Period 10: repeat [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 1, 3, 4, 7].
%C A226251 Previous name was: Concatenated cyclical sequence starting from Fibonacci sequence.
%C A226251 Start with the Fibonacci sequence 0,1,1,2,3,5,8; at this point rewrite the next term 13 as 1,3 and continue adding: 1,3,4,7. At this point rewrite the sum 11 as 1,1 and the sequence will recur if values greater than or equal to 10 are rewritten as two single-digit values as 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,1,3,4,7,1,1,2,3,5,8,1,3,4,7,1,1,...

%e A226251 However if the sequence starts with one of the following, (0,7),(1,4),(2,6),(3,1),(4,2),(4,5),(5,9),(6,8),(7,0),(7,7),(8,6),(9,5) the sequence converges to 1,4,5,9 which is listed as a subsequence of A000285. For all but the trivial exception (0,0) the rest of the two-digit combinations when added together will generate the sequence.

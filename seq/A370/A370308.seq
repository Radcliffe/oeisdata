%N A370308 Values d for the discriminant d^2 = 4*p^3 - 27*q^2 of the depressed cubic equation x^3 - p*x + q = 0 that give integer roots using integer coefficients p > 0 and q > 0 for increasing p sorted by p then q.
%C A370308 To obtain integer roots from the depressed cubic x^3 - p*x + q = 0, its discriminant 4*p^3 - 27*q^2 has to be a perfect square but this is not a sufficient condition. At least one root has to be integral as well.

%e A370308 a(1) = 0 and occurs when (p, q) = (3, 2). The depressed cubic is x^3 - 3*x + 2 and has roots {-2, 1, 1}.
%e A370308 a(2) = 20 and occurs when (p, q) = (7, 6). The depressed cubic is x^3 - 7*x + 6 and has roots {-3, 1, 2}.
%e A370308 a(3) = 0 and occurs when (p, q) = (12, 16). The depressed cubic is x^3 - 12*x + 16 and has roots {-4, 2, 2}.
%e A370308 a(4) = 70 and occurs when (p, q) = (13, 12). The depressed cubic is x^3 - 13*x + 12 and has roots {-4, 1, 3}.

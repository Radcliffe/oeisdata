This is an expanded version of the paper by Jianqiang Zhao, <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/geometry2030012">The Largest Circle Enclosing n Lattice Points</a>, Geometry, Vol. 2 (2025), 12.
%e A387045 It can be proved that the largest circle enclosing exactly 5 or 6 lattice points in the interior on the xy-plane does not exist. Number 5 is the smallest nonnegative integer having this property and 6 is the next. Therefore, a(1)=5 and a(2)=6.
%e A387045 Here is a brief argument. For details, please see my arxiv paper 2505.06234.
%e A387045 First, let C be the circle going through (-1,0) centered at (1/2,1/2). It passes exactly 8 lattice points and encloses exactly 4. Now with (-1,0) fixed on the circle we can shrink C by an infinitesimal amount to circle C' so that C' only goes through one lattice point (-1,0). Then another infinitesimal perturbation will move C' to include exactly 5 lattice points in its interior. Another infinitesimal perturbation will move C' to include exactly 6 lattice points in its interior. Therefore, if the largest circle enclosing exactly 5 or 6 interior lattice points exists, then its radius is at least sqrt(10)/2.
%e A387045 Second, a geometric argument shows that if the radius of a circle is at least sqrt(10)/2 then it encloses either exactly 4 interior lattice points or at least 7 interior lattice points.

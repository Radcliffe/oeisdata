%N A056842 Number of polydrafters: a(n) is the number of polydrafters with n cells.
%C A056842 See the Paterson link for the definition.
%C A056842 Restatement of the definition: A polydrafter is a polygon formed by joining 30-60-90 triangles, according to the following rules:
%C A056842 (a) Two triangles may be joined along their short legs, with their right angles touching;
%C A056842 (b) Two triangles may be joined along their long legs, with their right angles touching;
%C A056842 (c) Two triangles may be joined along their hypotenuses, in either direction;
%C A056842 (d) The short leg of triangle 1 may be joined to half of the hypotenuse of triangle 2, with the right angle of triangle 1 touching the midpoint of the hypotenuse of triangle 2.

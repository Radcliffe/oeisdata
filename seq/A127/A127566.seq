%N A127566 Primes p such that at least one of k-1, k+1 is prime, where k = absolute value of q^2 - p*r and p, q, r are consecutive primes.
%C A127566 k is always an even number.
%C A127566 Agrees with A049545 for the first 26 terms; first divergence is at 109.

%e A127566 31, 37, 41 are consecutive primes, 31^2 - 37*41 = -556. 557 is prime, hence 31 is a term.
%e A127566 53, 59, 61 are consecutive primes, 59^2 - 53*61 = 248. Both 247 = 13*19 and 249 = 3*83 are composite, hence 53 is not in the sequence.

%N A227762 Numbers in whose minimally runlength-encoded unordered partition all parts are equal; positions of zeros in A227761.
%C A227762 After 3 no more primes. First missing composites are: 14, 18, 21, 22, 26, 27, 32, 33, 34, 38, 39, 40, ...
%e A227762 The first row in A227739 (please see its Example section) that sums to 6 occurs as its row 8 (= A227368(6)). The corresponding partition {3+3} contains only equal parts, thus 6 is a member of this sequence. The first row in A227739 that sums to 5 occurs as its row 9 (= A227368(5)). The corresponding partition {1+2+2} contains more than just one kind of summands, thus 5 do not occur in this sequence.

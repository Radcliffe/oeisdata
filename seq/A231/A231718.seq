%N A231718 Positions of ones in A231717.
%C A231718 This sequence gives all n at which positions the successive terms A219666(n-1) & A219666(n) in the infinite trunk of the factorial beanstalk differ only in one digit position in their factorial base representations (A007623) and the difference of those digits is exactly one.

%F A231718 For all n, A230406(a(n)) = A000142(A231719(a(n))).
%e A231718 14 is included, because A219666(13) = 40 = '1220' in factorial base representation, while A219666(14) = 46 = '1320' in factorial base, and they differ only by the third least significant digits, and 3-2 = 1.

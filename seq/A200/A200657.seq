%N A200657 Successive values y such that Mordell elliptic curve x^3 - y^2 = d has a quadratic extension over rationals.
%C A200657 For x values see A200656.
%C A200657 For d values see A200658.
%C A200657 Definition: Secondary terms occurred when existed such integer k that A200656 is divisible by k^2 and A200657 is divisible by k^3 and A200658 is divisible by k^6.
%C A200657 Terms free of such k are primary terms.
%C A200657 Secondary terms are: a(6)=a(2)*2^3, a(7)=a(3)*2^3.
%C A200657 A200217 is subset of this sequence.

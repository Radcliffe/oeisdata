%N A384327 Minimal Trips Around The Collatz Galaxy: a(n) is the minimal cycle length containing n. Each step in the cycle must be either to the next larger integer or follow a Collatz trajectory: k -> 3k+1 if k is odd or k -> k/2 if k is even.
%C A384327 Excellent puzzle to get elementary students engaged in arithmetic. Recommended for use after the Collatz conjecture (3x+1 conjecture) is introduced side-by-side with its 3x-1 cousin.

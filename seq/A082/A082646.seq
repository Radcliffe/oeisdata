%N A082646 Primes whose decimal expansions contain equal numbers of each of their digits.
%C A082646 All repunit primes (A004022) are terms. There are no terms of prime p digit- length for p >= 11 unless p is a term of A004023 - in which case there is exactly one such term here, the repunit prime of length p. The smallest term whose digits are neither all the same nor all different is 100313. No term of digit-length 10 can have digits all different because such a term would be divisible by 3 (as 45, the sum of its digits, would be divisible by 3).

%e A082646 The prime 101 is not a term because it contains two 1's but only one 0.
%e A082646 The prime 127 is a term because it has one 1, one 2 and one 7.

%N A334720 Number of 2-dimensional closed-loop self-avoiding paths on a square lattice where each path consists of steps with incrementing length from 1 to n.
%C A334720 This sequence gives the number of closed-loop self avoiding walks on a 2D square lattice where the walk starts with a step length of 1 which then increments by 1 after each step up until the step length is n. No closed-loop path is possible until n = 7.
%C A334720 Like A010566 all possible paths are counted, including those that are equivalent via rotation and reflection.
%C A334720 For n = 8, 15, 20, 24, 27, 32, 35, 39, 44, ... =  A380867, the path can be a rectangle. The first two cases are illustrated through the "Images" link from _Scott R. Shannon_. These numbers correspond to triangular numbers T(n) for which there are n1 > n2 > n3 > n4 >= 0 such that T(n) = 2(A+B) for A = T(n1) - T(n2) = T(n3) - T(n4) and B = T(n2) - T(n3). See A380867 for more. - _M. F. Hasler_, Mar 14 2025

%e A334720 a(1) to a(6) = 0 as no closed-loop is possible.
%e A334720 a(7) = 8 as there is one path which forms a closed loop which can be walked in 8 different ways on a 2D square lattice. The path is:

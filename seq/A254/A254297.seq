%N A254297 Consider the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line 1/2 + i*t and the gap, or first difference, between two consecutive such zeros; a(n) is the lesser of the two zeros at a place where the gap attains a new minimum.
%C A254297 Since all zeros are assumed to be on the critical line, the gap, or first difference, between two consecutive zeros is measured as the difference between the two imaginary parts.
%C A254297 Inspired by A002410.
%C A254297 No other terms < 10000000. The minimum gap so far is 0.002323...

%e A254297 a(1)=1 since the first Riemann zeta zero, 1/2 + i*14.13472514... (A058303) has no previous zero, so its gap is measured from 0.
%e A254297 a(2)=2 since the second Riemann zeta zero, 1/2 + i*21.02203964... (A065434) has a gap of 6.887314497... which is less than the previous gap of ~14.13472514.
%e A254297 a(3)=3 since the third Riemann zeta zero, 1/2 + i*25.01085758... (A065452) has a gap of 3.988817941... which is less than ~6.887314497.
%e A254297 The fourth Riemann zeta zero, 1/2 + i*30.42487613... (A065453) has a gap of 5.414018546... which is not less than ~6.887314497 and therefore is not in the sequence.
%e A254297 a(4)=5 since the fifth Riemann zeta zero, 1/2 + i*32.93506159... (A192492) has a gap of 2.510185462... which is less than ~3.988817941.
%e A254297 a(5)=8 since the eighth Riemann zeta zero, 1/2 + i*43.32707328...  has a gap of 2.408354269... which is less than ~2.510185462.

%N A372553 Center column of elementary triangular automaton rule 61, starting from a lone 1 cell.
%C A372553 An Elementary Triangular Automaton (ETA) is a cellular automaton in the triangular grid where cells hold binary states and rules are local to the first neighborhood. There are 256 possible ETA rules.
%C A372553 Rule 61 (111101 in binary):

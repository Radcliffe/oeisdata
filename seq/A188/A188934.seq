%N A188934 Decimal expansion of (1+sqrt(17))/4.
%C A188934 Decimal expansion of the length/width ratio of a (1/2)-extension rectangle.  See A188640 for definitions of shape and r-extension rectangle.
%C A188934 A (1/2)-extension rectangle matches the continued fraction [1,3,1,1,3,1,1,3,1,1,3,...] for the shape L/W=(1+sqrt(17))/4.  This is analogous to the matching of a golden rectangle to the continued fraction [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,...].  Specifically, for the (1/2)-extension rectangle, 1 square is removed first, then 3 squares, then 1 square, then 1 square,..., so that the original rectangle of shape (1+sqrt(17))/4 is partitioned into an infinite collection of squares.
%C A188934 Conjecture: This number is an eigenvalue to infinitely many n*n submatrices of A191898, starting in the upper left corner, divided by the row index. For the first few characteristic polynomials see A260237 and A260238. - _Mats Granvik_, May 12 2016.
%C A188934 Hexagonal root of 2. In other words, the nonnegative solution to x*(2*x-1) = 2. Compare A000384. - _Kelvin Voskuijl_, Sep 05 2025

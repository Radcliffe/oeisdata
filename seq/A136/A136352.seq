%N A136352 Primorials P for which neither P-1 nor P+1 is prime.
%C A136352 This sequence is different from A121069 and A002110.
%C A136352 For almost all primes p, p# is in this sequence by Brun's theorem. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Sep 14 2015

%F A136352 Compute P = product of the first k primes. If P is neither preceded nor followed by a prime add P to the sequence.
%e A136352 13# = 30030 is preceded by a prime but is not followed by a prime. 17# = 510510 is neither preceded nor followed by a prime.

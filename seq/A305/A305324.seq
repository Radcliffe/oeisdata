%N A305324 Number of one-sided 'divisible' polyominoes of size 2^(n-1), where a 'divisible' polyomino is either a monomino (square) or a polyomino which can be separated into two identical 'divisible' polyominoes.
%C A305324 a(n) is nonzero for any n >= 1. Proof is trivial by induction.
%C A305324 a(n) <= A000988(2^(n-1)) as any polyomino counted here is also counted in A000988.
%e A305324 For n = 3 (polyominoes of size 4), the 'divisible' polyominoes are the I, O, J, L, S and Z tetrominoes. The T tetromino is not 'divisible'.
%Y A305324 Cf. A000988.

%N A304284 Numbers equal to the sum of their aliquot parts, each of them decreased by 8.

%C A304284 If p = 2^(1+t) + (1+2*t)*k - 1 is a prime, for some t > 0 and k even, then x = 2^t*p is in the sequence, where k is the value by which the sum of aliquot parts is increased. In this sequence k = -8; for t = 23 we get a(22) = 140734325850112.
%C A304284 There could be also sporadic solutions of the type x = 2^t*r*q, where r and q are prime and for which no closed form is known. E.g. for k = -8 we have x = 2^26*134442677*80216006459.
%C A304284 To find them, since d(n) = 4*(t+1) and sigma(n) = (2^(t+1)-1)*(1+r)*(1+q), the relation 2*n = sigma(n) + k*(d(n)-1) becomes 2^(t+1)*r*q = (2^(t+1)-1)*(1+r)*(1+q) + k*(4*t+3), which, for fixed t and k, is a quadratic Diophantine equation in r and q that could admit solutions with r and q prime.

%C A304284 Terms using odd values of k seem very hard to find. Up to n = 10^12, only three such terms are known: 2, 98, and 8450, for k = 1, 5, and -7, respectively.
%e A304284 Aliquot parts of 120 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60 and (1-8) + (2-8) + (3-8) + (4-8) + (5-8) + (6-8) + (8-8) + (10-8) + (12-8) + (15-8) + (20-8) + (24-8) + (30-8) + (40-8) + (60-8) = 120.

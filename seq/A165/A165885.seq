%N A165885 Minimum sum of a set of positive integers such that every positive integer <= n is the sum of 1 or 2 elements of the set.
%C A165885 If it is possible to make every value from 1 to n using at most 2 of the coins used in a country, what is the minimum possible value of the sum of the coins in this country?
%C A165885 By considering sets {1, 2, ..., r, 2r, 3r, ..., (s-1)r}, it is conjectured that the asymptotic behavior is a(n) ~ 3/4 * 2^(1/3) * n^(4/3).

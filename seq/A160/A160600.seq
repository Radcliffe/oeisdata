%N A160600 Numbers k such that 3*(2k)^(2k)+1 is prime.
%C A160600 This corresponds to the numbers such that 3m^m+1 is prime, but these must all be even, m=2k, and therefore it is more natural to record the sequence of k=m/2.

%e A160600 a(1) = 1, because 2^2*3+1 = 13 is the smallest prime of this form.
%e A160600 a(2) = 2, because 4^4*3+1 = 769 is the next smallest prime of this form. a(3) = 3, because 6^6*3+1 = 139969 is again a prime.

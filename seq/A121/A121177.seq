%N A121177 Catapolyoctagons (see Cyvin et al. for precise definition).
%C A121177 From _Petros Hadjicostas_, Jul 30 2019: (Start)
%C A121177 The conjecture by _Philipp Emanuel Weidmann_ (see link below) is correct. In Cyvin et al. (1997), this sequence has a double meaning. See Eqs. (6) and (7) and Table I on p. 58 in that paper. The terms of the sequence are related to the enumeration of unbranched catapolyoctagons.
%C A121177 The number of unbranched catapolyoctagons of the symmetry C_{2h} is given by c_r = (1/2) *(5^(floor(r/2)-1) - 1) + (2/5) * binomial(1, r), where r is the number of octagons in the unbranched catapolyoctagon. We get the sequence 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 12, 12, 62, 62, 312, 312, ... whose bijection (apart for the case r = 1) is the current sequence.
%C A121177 In addition, the number of unbranched catapolyoctagons of the symmetry C_{2v} is given by m_r = (1/2) * (3 - 2*(-1)^r) * 5^(floor(r/2) - 1) - (1/2), where again r is the number of octagons. We get the sequence 0, 0, 2, 2, 12, 12, 62, 62, 312, 312, 1562, 1562, ... whose bijection is the current sequence.
%C A121177 The total number of unbranched catapolygons (with respect to all the symmetry point groups D_{8h}, D_{2h}, C_{2h}, and C_{2v}) is given by i_r = A121101(r).

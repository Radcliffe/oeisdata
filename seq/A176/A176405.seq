%N A176405 Fixed point of morphism 0->0100110, 1->0110110.
%C A176405 Also a(n) is the least significant nonzero digit in the radix-7 expansion of (n+1).
%C A176405 The sequence, interpreted as left/right turns by 120 degrees (each turn followed by a unit line in the current direction) defines a space-filling curve (called R7-dragon in the fxtbook, see link below).
%C A176405 Also sequence of zeros and ones by morphism F->F0F1F1F0F0F1F, 0->0, 1->1.

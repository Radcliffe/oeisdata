%N A177760 Values m in solutions of the Thue equation s^2 = m^5+z, sorted along increasing z.
%C A177760 The equation has solutions for the positive z listed in A152412.
%C A177760 A177761 and this sequence here show pairs (s,m) that solve given these z>0. (The case z=0 has infinitely many solutions which are not included here.)
%C A177760 There is no 1-to-1 relation to these z because more than one (s,m) may exist for some z, in case of which all are listed here.
%F A177760 A177761(n)^2 = a(n)^5 + A152412(k) for some k>1.
%e A177760 (s=59, m=5=a(57), z=356) and (s=182, m=8=a(58), z=356) are solutions associated with z = A152412(57) =356.
%e A177760 (s=20, m=2=a(60), z=368) and (s=45531, m=73=a(61), z=368) are solutions associated with z = A152412(59) =368.

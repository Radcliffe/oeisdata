%N A368856 Atomic numbers with at least two beta-stable isotopes of odd mass number.
%C A368856 A beta-stable nuclide is a nuclide whose beta decay (beta-minus and beta-plus decay) is energetically disallowed; that is to say, a nuclide that has lower energy than its isobars with one more or one less proton. Note that double beta decay is allowed. A nuclide whose beta decay is energetially allowed, even if not observed (in the case of 48Ca, 96Zr, 123Te, 148Gd, 180mTa, 222Rn and 247Cm), is not classified as being beta-stable.
%C A368856 For n <= 101 not being a term in this sequence, there is only one odd-mass beta-stable isotope for element n, except that there is none for n = 18, 43, 58 and 61.
%C A368856 2 is a term because even if 5He has extremely short half-life, it is beta-stable. 48, 49 and 52 are not terms because 113Cd, 115In and 123Te are not beta-stable as primordial nuclides.
%C A368856 Different models predict different continuations for this sequence: Page 12 of the Zagrebaev et al. link predicts 101, (3 numbers in 105 ~ 108, assuming Lr and Mt each have a beta-stable isotopes and Sg, Bh and Hs each have at most two beta-stable isotopes of odd mass number), 110, 112, 114 (page 12). A Russian source predicts 102, 104, 105 or 106, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118. Pages 14-15 of the Hiroyuki Koura link predict 101, 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 113, 116, 117, 118, 120, 122, 124 (pages 14-15).
%C A368856 In contrast to many terms being known for this sequence, there are only four known neutron numbers with two beta-stable isotones of odd mass number: 20 (37Cl and 39K), 55 (97Mo and 99Ru), 82 (139La and 141Pr) and 85 (145Nd and 147Sm). The two even neutron numbers are close to the elements Ar and Ce which have only even-even beta-stable isotopes, and the two odd ones surround the elements Tc and Pm which have no beta-stable isotopes. The Zagrebaev et al. link predicts two beta-stable isotones with neutron number 181 (293Cn and 295Fl), with Nh having no beta-stable isotopes.

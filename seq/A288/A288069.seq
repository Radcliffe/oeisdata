%N A288069 Quotients obtained when the Zuckerman numbers are divided by the product of their digits.
%C A288069 The Zuckerman numbers (A007602) are the numbers that are divisible by the product of their digits.
%C A288069 Question: Is A067251 a subsequence? No, it appears in A056770 that not all integers other than multiples of 10 can be obtained as quotient, such as 15, 16, 24, 25, 26, 32, .... (see A342941).
%C A288069 The limit of the sequence is infinite: for any x, there is some N such that, for all n > N, a(n) > x. Proof: a Zuckerman number with d digits is at least 10^(d-1) and has a digit product at most 9^d and so has a quotient at least 10^(d-1)/9^d which goes to infinity with d. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Jun 05 2017

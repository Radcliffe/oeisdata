%N A199044 The number of identity elements of length n in Z*Z^2.
%C A199044 Z*Z^2 is the free product of the free group on one letter (say, x) and the free abelian group on two letters (say, y and z).
%C A199044 Viewed as the quotient of the free group F on three letters {x,y,z} by the normal subgroup generated by the commutator [y,z], the sequence gives the number of words in F of length n that are sent to the identity in Z*Z^2 under the quotient map.
%C A199044 Note that odd-numbered terms are zero.

%e A199044 The identity from the free group F maps to the identity in Z*Z^2, and is the only word of length zero in F, so a(0)=1.
%e A199044 The group Z*Z^2 maps onto the direct product C_2^3, the group of exponent 2 with 8 elements. Therefore no elements of odd length are sent to the identity and thus a(2i-1)=0 for all positive integers i.
%e A199044 The only word of length zero is the empty word, which vacuously represents the identity. Therefore, a_0=1.
%e A199044 For n=2, there are a_2=6 identities; each is a (positive or negative) generator x,y, or z, followed or preceded by its inverse. We have the words x*x^-1, y*y^-1, z*z^-1, plus the reverse of each.

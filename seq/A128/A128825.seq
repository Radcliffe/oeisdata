%N A128825 Primes p such that q = p+d (with d >= 6) is the next prime and both p and q are Sophie Germain primes.
%C A128825 Sophie Germain primes are primes p such that 2*p+1 is also prime.

%e A128825 653 and 659 are consecutive primes with difference 6. 2*653 + 1 = 1307 is prime and 2*659 + 1 = 1319 is prime. Hence 653 is a term.
%e A128825 1499 and 1511 are consecutive primes with difference 12 >= 6. 2*1499 + 1 = 2999 is prime and 2*1511 + 1 = 3023 is prime. Hence 1499 is a term.

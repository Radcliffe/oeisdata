%N A253784 Numbers which have no two successive prime factors (when sorted into monotonic order) where the latter prime factor would be greater than the square of the former.
%C A253784 In other words, {1} together with primes and such composite numbers n = p_i * p_j * p_k * ... * p_u, p_i <= p_j <= p_k <= ... <= p_u, where each successive prime factor (when sorted into a nondecreasing order) is less than the square of the previous: (p_i)^2 > p_j, (p_j)^2 > p_k, etc.
%C A253784 Whenever gcd(a(i),a(j)) > 1, then a(i)*a(j) and lcm(a(i),a(j)) are also members of this sequence.

%e A253784 1 is present as it has an empty prime factorization.
%e A253784 2 like all primes is present.
%e A253784 4 = 2*2 is present as 2^2 > 2.
%e A253784 9 = 3*3 is present as 3^2 > 3.
%e A253784 10 = 2*5 is NOT present, as 2^2 < 5.
%e A253784 30 = 2*3*5 is present, as 2^2 > 3 and 3^2 > 5.

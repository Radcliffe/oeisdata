%N A376190 For a line L in the plane, let C(L) denote the number of prime points [k, prime(k)] on L, and let M(L) denote the maximum prime(k) for any of these points. a(n) is the maximum of the smallest primes in the lines L with C(L) = n and containing prime A376187(n), or a(n) = -1 if no such lines exist.
%C A376190 Consider all the lines L in the plane containing exactly n prime-points (k, prime(k)). A376187 minimizes the maximal prime on any such line L, while the present sequence then maximizes the minimal prime on the lines from A376187.
%C A376190 In other words, we first minimize (in A376187) the maximal prime over all lines with exactly n points, and then here we further maximize the minimal prime. The second step minimizes the spread of the points.
%C A376190 For most listed terms, there is only one line L with C(L) = n that contains prime A376187(n). - _Max Alekseyev_, Sep 28 2024

%e A376190 The best line with 5 points contains the primes 19,23,31,43,47, so a(5) = 19 and A376187(5) = 47. See the Table for further examples.

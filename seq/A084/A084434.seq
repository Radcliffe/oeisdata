%N A084434 Numbers whose digit permutations have GCD > 1.
%C A084434 Numbers k such that there is a number d>1 which divides every number that can be obtained by permuting the digits of k. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Aug 27 2020
%C A084434 Theorem. The sequence consists of: (1) A008585 (multiples of 3), (2) A014263 (numbers with all digits even), (3) A014181 (numbers with all digits equal), (4) numbers with all digits 5 or 0, (5) numbers with all digits 7 or 0, (6) numbers with 6k digits, all of which are 1 or 8, and (7) numbers with 6k digits, all of which are 2 or 9. - _David Wasserman_, May 07 2004
%e A084434 72 is in the sequence because 72 and 27 are both divisible by 9.

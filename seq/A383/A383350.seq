%N A383350 a(n) is the smallest integer k such that there are k+i groups of order a(n)+i, for i=1,...,n.
%C A383350 The sequence is finite. For any multiple of 32, there are more than 32 groups of that order. Thus, the sequence 1,2,...,32 can't appear in A000001, and this sequence is at most 31 terms long.
%C A383350 From a(2) onwards, each entry is a multiple of 24, but not a multiple of 48.
%C A383350 a(7) > 223000000 if it exists.
%C A383350 Each entry is congruent to 0, 2 or 4 modulo 5.
%e A383350 a(1) = 0 since there is 1 group of order 1.
%e A383350 a(2) = 2 since there is 1 group of order 3, 2 groups of order 4.
%Y A383350 Cf. A373648, A373649, A373650, A381335.

%N A129017 Isomer numbers for the constant-isomer series: the monradical, diradical, triradical, tetraradical, etc. series.
%C A129017 The terms occur in groups of three, X, X, Y.
%C A129017 From _Petros Hadjicostas_, Nov 17 2019: (Start)
%C A129017 When we count diradical isomers, the starting compounds for each constant-isomer series are as follows (with the number of diradical isomers inside parentheses): C22H12 (1), C30H14 (1), C40H16 (1), C50H18 (2), C62H20 (4), C76H22 (4), C90H24 (12), C106H26 (19), C124H28 (19), C142H30 (46), C162H32 (70), C184H34 (70), C206H36 (162), C230H38 (239), C256H40 (239), C282H42 (504), C310H44 (726), C340H46 (726), C370H48 (1471), C402H50 (2062), C436H52 (2062).
%C A129017 For some mysterious reason, the ground compounds of each series, which are listed above, obey the general formula C_{2*b(s)} H_{2*s}, where b(s) = A096777(s), for s = 6, 7, ..., 26.
%C A129017 Given a ground compound in a constant-isomer series of compounds, the series is determined by the operator P(C_n H_s) -> C_{n + 2*s + 6} H_{s + 6}. For example, the series corresponding to the C22H12 is C22H12 -> C52H18 -> C94H24 -> C148H30 -> C214H36 -> ...
%C A129017 As it can be seen in Dias (1996), the same numbers appear for the number of monoradical isomers for odd-carbon compounds starting with C13H9. See also Table 1 in Dias (1991, p. 128). Here we have the following starting compounds for each constant-isomer series (with the number of monoradical isomers in parentheses): C13H9 (1), C19H11 (1), C27H13(1), C35H15 (2), C45H17 (4), C57H19 (4), C69H21 (12), C83H23 (19), C99H25 (19), C115H27 (46), ...
%C A129017 For additional interpretations of these numbers (e.g., in terms of tetraradicals), see the equations and theory in Dias (1993).
%C A129017 The "base formulas for the smallest one-isomer polyradicals" appear in Section 7.6 in Dias (1996), which explains why we begin with C22H12 for the number of diradical isomers and with C13H9 for the number of monoradicals.

%N A083391 n-th Payam number E_{-}(n), defined as the smallest positive odd integer k such that for every positive integer n, the number k*2^n-1 is not divisible by any primes p such that the multiplicative order of 2 mod p is less than or equal to e.
%C A083391 Payam numbers yield many primes of the form k*2^n+1 (Proth primes) and k*2^n-1.

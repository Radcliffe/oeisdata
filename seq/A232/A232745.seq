%N A232745 Numbers k for which the largest m such that m! divides k is even.
%C A232745 Numbers k for which A055881(k) is even.
%C A232745 Equally: Numbers k which have an odd number of the trailing zeros in their factorial base representation A007623(k).
%C A232745 The sequence can be described in the following manner: Sequence includes all multiples of 2! (even numbers), except that it excludes from those the multiples of 3! (6), except that it includes the multiples of 4! (24), except that it excludes the multiples of 5! (120), except that it includes the multiples of 6! (720), except that it excludes the multiples of 7! (5040), except that it includes the multiples of 8! (40320), except that it excludes the multiples of 9! (362880), except that it includes the multiples of 10! (3628800), except that ..., ad infinitum.
%C A232745 The number of terms not exceeding m! for m>=1 is A000166(m). The asymptotic density of this sequence is 1/e (A068985). - _Amiram Eldar_, Feb 26 2021

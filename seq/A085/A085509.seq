%N A085509 Numbers containing no zero digits in bases 3 to 10.
%C A085509 To extend to base 2 only numbers of the form 2^n-1 need to be considered, since all others have zero digits in base 2.
%C A085509 Tested up to 2^45 - 1 and found no term (other than 1) which doesn't contain zeros in one of the other bases 3 to 10.
%C A085509 Tested up to 2^50000 - 1 and found no such term. - _Robert G. Wilson v_
%C A085509 Several of these come in pairs such as 1 & 2, 22 & 23, 121 & 122, 157 & 158, 5818 & 5819, etc. See A085828. There is also a near-triple in 154534, 154537, 154538, 154543.
%C A085509 But no such triple can exist, since, given three consecutive numbers, one must be divisible by 3, which implies that it ends in a zero in base 3. - _Robert G. Wilson v_

%N A262037 Replace the second half of digits of n with the first half in reverse order.
%C A262037 This is related to the "palindromic floor" and "palindromic ceiling" functions A261423 and A262038: a(n) = A261423(n) iff the first half of digits reversed does not exceed the second half of digits (without considering the middle digit in case of an odd number of digits), and a(n) = A262038(n) in the opposite case, i.e., first half of digits reversed is greater than or equal to second half of digits.
%C A262037 a(n) is either equal to the palindromic floor A261423(n) (e.g., a(1234) = 1221), or to the palindromic ceiling A262038(n) (= next larger palindrome, e.g., a(1324)=1331). In this sense it can be seen as a "palindromic round" function. However, it does not always yield the closest of the two (a(1900) = 1991 but 1881 would be closer to 1900). The sequence A262040 which has this property would better merit the name of "palindromic round function".
%C A262037 This simple function can be used to construct the next larger or next smaller palindrome, A261423 and A262038: indeed, if a(n) has the required property (less than or greater than n) then it is already the desired result, otherwise the result is given by a(n +- 10^k), where k is half the number of digits of n.

%e A262037 a(31) = 33 since the second half ("1") gets replaced by the first half ("3").
%e A262037 a(314) = 313 since the second half ("4") is replaced by the first half ("3"), the middle "1" being untouched.
%e A262037 a(3141) = 3113 since the second half (41) is replaced by the first half (31), reversed (13).
%e A262037 a(31415) = 31413 as above, the middle 4 being left untouched.
%e A262037 a(314156) = 314413. This is the first instance in these examples where a(n) differs from A261423(n), which would yield 313313 here.

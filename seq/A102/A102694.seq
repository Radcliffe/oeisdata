%N A102694 Take the n-th pair of consecutive digits of the sequence and form their absolute difference; the result is the n-th digit of the sequence; a(n) < a(n+1).
%C A102694 Start with a(1) = 1. In general choose a(n) to be the smallest number consistent with a(i) (for i < n) and the other requirements.
%e A102694 First pair of digits is [12]; absolute difference = 1; 1 is the first digit of the sequence.
%e A102694 2nd pair of digits is [35]; absolute difference = 2; 2 is the 2nd digit of the sequence.
%e A102694 3rd pair of digits is [69]; absolute difference = 3; 3 is the 3rd digit of the sequence.
%e A102694 4th pair of digits is [16]; absolute difference = 5; 5 is the 4th digit of the sequence.

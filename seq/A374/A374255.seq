%N A374255 Sum of prime factors of n (with multiplicity) minus the greatest possible sum of run-compression of a permutation of the prime factors of n.
%C A374255 Contains no ones.
%C A374255 We define the run-compression of a sequence to be the anti-run obtained by reducing each run of repeated parts to a single part. Alternatively, run-compression removes all parts equal to the part immediately to their left. For example, (1,1,2,2,1) has run-compression (1,2,1).
%F A374255 a(n) = A001414(n) - A374250(n).
%e A374255 The prime factors of 96 are {2,2,2,2,2,3}, with sum 13, and we have permutations such as (2,2,2,2,3,2), with run-compression (2,3,2), with sum 7, so a(96) = 13 - 7 = 6.

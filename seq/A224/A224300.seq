%N A224300 Collatz problem with rational negative numbers: number of steps to reach the end of the cycle starting with 1/(2n+1) where n is negative (the initial value is counted).
%C A224300 This variation of the "3x+1" problem with a class of rational negative numbers is as follows: start with any number 1/(2n+1), n= -1, -2, -3, .... If the numerator is even, divide it by 2, otherwise multiply it by 3 and add 1. Do we always reach the end of a cycle with a rational number? It is conjectured that the answer is yes. This sequence is an extension of A210471 with n negative.

%F A224300 a(n) = A224299(n) + 1.
%e A224300 For n = 3, a(3) = 10 because the corresponding trajectory of -1/7 requires 10 iterations (the first term -1/7 is counted) to reach the last term of the cycle: -1/7 -> 4/7 -> 2/7 -> 1/7 -> 10/7 -> 5/7 -> 22/7 -> 11/7 -> 40/7 -> 20/7 and 20/7 is the last term because 20/7 -> 10/7 is already in the trajectory.

%N A374248 Sum of prime indices of n (with multiplicity) minus the greatest possible sum of run-compression of a permutation of the prime indices of n.
%C A374248 We define the run-compression of a sequence to be the anti-run obtained by reducing each run of repeated parts to a single part. Alternatively, run-compression removes all parts equal to the part immediately to their left. For example, (1,1,2,2,1) has run-compression (1,2,1).
%C A374248 A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798.
%F A374248 a(n) = A056239(n) - A373956(n).
%e A374248 The prime indices of 96 are {1,1,1,1,1,2}, with sum 7, and we have permutations such as (1,1,1,1,2,1), with run-compression (1,2,1), with sum 4, so a(96) = 7 - 4 = 3.

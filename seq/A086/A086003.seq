%N A086003 Primes which remain prime after one and after two applications of the rotate-and-add operation of A086002.
%C A086003 The rotate operation of nonnegative integers is defined in A086002, which lists the primes that remain prime after one application of the compound rotate-and-add operation. The sequence here lists those primes p which in addition remain prime after applying this transformation twice, that is, those elements of A086002 such that the image of the rotate-and-add operation is again in A086002.

%F A086003 {p in A086002: p+rot(p) in A086002}.
%e A086003 a(6)=12917 because (i) 12917 is prime. (ii) rotate(12917) = 17912 and 12917+17912=30829 which is also prime. (iii) rotate(30829) = 29830 and 30829+29830=60659 which is also prime.

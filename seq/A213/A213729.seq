%N A213729 Sequence A179016 reduced modulo 2.
%C A213729 It holds for all n>=1 that a(n) = A179016(n)-A213723(A179016(n-1)) meaning that a(n) = 1 when the next node upwards in the infinite trunk of beanstalk sequence (A179016) is the larger of the two possible branches from A179016(n), and 0 when it is the smaller of the said branches. That is, this sequence tells whether A179016 proceeds "left" or "right" at each step.
%C A213729 If we were able to find the values of this sequence "a priori" (without needing the value of A179016 at the same point and taking modulo 2 from it), then A179016 could be computed in a more straightforward "bottom-up manner", as then we would have enough information to find the correct path in the binary tree of beanstalk up to the infinity.

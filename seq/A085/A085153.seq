%N A085153 All prime factors of n and n+1 are <= 7. (Related to the abc conjecture.)
%C A085153 The ABC conjecture would imply that if the prime factors of A, B, C are prescribed in advance, then there is only a finite number of solutions to the equation A + B = C with gcd(A,B,C)=1 (indeed it would bound C to be no more than "roughly" the product of those primes). So in particular there ought to be only finitely many pairs of adjacent integers whose prime factors are limited to {2, 3, 5, 7} (D. Rusin).
%C A085153 This sequence is complete by a theorem of Stormer. See A002071. - _T. D. Noe_, Mar 03 2008
%C A085153 This is the 4th row of the table A138180. It has 23=A002071(4)=A145604(1)+...+ A145604(4) terms and ends with A002072(4)=4374. It is the union of all terms in rows 1 through 4 of the table A145605. It is a subsequence of A252494 and contains A085152 as a subsequence. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jan 16 2015
%C A085153 Equivalently, this is the sequence of numbers for which A074399(n) <= 7, or A252489(n) <= 4.

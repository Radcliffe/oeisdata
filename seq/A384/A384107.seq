%N A384107 Number of connected components of n faces of the icosidodecahedron up to the 120 rotations and reflections of the icosidodecahedron.
%C A384107 Two faces are connected if they share an edge.
%C A384107 These are "free" polyforms because both rotations and reflections are allowed.
%C A384107 The icosidodecahedron is the polyhedral dual of the rhombic triacontahedron.

%e A384107 a(1) = 2 because the icosidodecahedron is not face transitive, but has two distinct orbits of faces: (1) triangles and (2) pentagons.

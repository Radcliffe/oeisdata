%N A160324 Number of ways to express n as the sum of a square, a pentagonal number and a hexagonal number.
%C A160324 In April 2009, _Zhi-Wei Sun_ conjectured that a(n)>0 for every n=0,1,2,3,.... Note that pentagonal numbers and hexagonal numbers are more sparse than squares and that there are infinitely many positive integers which cannot be written as the sum of three squares.
%C A160324 On Aug 12 2009, _Zhi-Wei Sun_ made the following general conjecture on diagonal representations by polygonal numbers: For each integer m>2, any natural number n can be written in the form p_{m+1}(x_1)+...+p_{2m}(x_m) with x_1,...,x_m nonnegative integers, where p_k(x)=(k-2)x(x-1)/2+x (x=0,1,2,...) are k-gonal numbers. Sun has verified this with m=3 for n up to 10^6, and with m=4,5,6,7,8,9,10 for n up to 5*10^5. - _Zhi-Wei Sun_, Aug 15 2009
%C A160324 On Aug 21 2009, _Zhi-Wei Sun_ formulated the following strong version for his conjecture on diagonal representations by polygonal numbers: For any integer m>2, each natural number n can be expressed as p_{m+1}(x_1)+p_{m+2}(x_2)+p_{m+3}(x_3)+r with x_1,x_2,x_3 nonnegative integers and r an integer among 0,...,m-3. For m=3 and m=4,5,6,7,8,9,10, Sun has verified this conjecture for n up to 10^6 and 5*10^5 respectively. Sun also guessed that for each m=3,4,... all sufficiently large integers have the form p_{m+1}(x_1)+p_{m+2}(x_2)+p_{m+3}(x_3) with x_1,x_2,x_3 nonnegative integers. For example, it seems that 387904 is the largest integer not in the form p_{20}(x_1)+p_{21}(x_2)+p_{22}(x_3). - _Zhi-Wei Sun_, Aug 21 2009
%C A160324 On Sep 04 2009, _Zhi-Wei Sun_ conjectured that the sequence contains every positive integer. For n=1,2,3,... let s(n) denote the least nonnegative integer m such that a(m)=n. Here is the list of s(1),...,s(30): 0, 9, 1, 6, 16, 36, 50, 37, 66, 82, 167, 121, 162, 236, 226, 276, 302, 446, 478, 532, 457, 586, 677, 521, 666, 852, 976, 877, 1006, 1046. - _Zhi-Wei Sun_, Sep 04 2009

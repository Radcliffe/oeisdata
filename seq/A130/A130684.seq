%N A130684 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) = number of squares (not necessarily orthogonal) all of whose vertices lie in an (n + 1) X (k + 1) square lattice.
%C A130684 Reading down the diagonal gives A002415.

%F A130684 T(n, k) = k*(k+1)*(k+2)*(2*n - k + 1)/12 (k <= n).
%e A130684 T(2, 2) = 6 because there are 6 squares all of whose vertices lie in a 3 X 3 lattice: four squares of side length 1, one square of side length 2 and one non-orthogonal square of side length the square root of 2.

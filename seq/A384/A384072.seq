%N A384072 Number of connected components of n faces of the snub cube up to the 24 rotations of the snub cube.
%C A384072 Two faces are connected if they share an edge.
%C A384072 These are "one-sided" polyforms because reflections are not allowed.
%C A384072 The snub cube is the polyhedral dual of the pentagonal icositetrahedron.

%e A384072 a(1) = 3 because the snub cube is not face transitive, but has three distinct orbits of faces: (1) squares, (2) triangles that are connected to a square, and (3) triangles that are not connected to a square.
%Y A384072 Cf. A383808 (pentagonal icositetrahedron).
%Y A384072 Cf. A309159 (snub square tiling), A383908 (snub trihexagonal tiling).

%N A119954 Y = X = 'i + .25(ii + jj + kk + e); Z = 'i - i' + .5(jj + kk - jk + kj) + e. See pdf-file and comment for an exact definition (this sequence gives an initial term 3); Version "les".
%C A119954 To obtain this sequence, follow the same instructions given for A119953. A119953(n) was obtained by adding the coefficients of 'i and i' at the end of the n-th iteration. a(n) is obtained by adding the coefficients of the basis vectors ij, ik, ji, jk, ki, kj at the end of the n-th iteration. Note: Some of these coefficients are always 0. "Version les" refers to the 6 basis vectors mentioned above.

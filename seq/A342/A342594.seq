%N A342594 Earliest occurrence of the next distinct width pattern (as listed in A342592) in the symmetric representation of sigma(n) not yet encountered as n increases.
%C A342594 The width pattern of the symmetric representation of sigma(a(n)) is the n-th row of the table of A342592.
%C A342594 Conjecture: If for some number n the symmetric representation of sigma(n) has the symmetric width pattern w in row n of A342592 then infinitely many numbers have that width pattern w.
%e A342594 a(1) = 1 is the smallest power of 2 whose symmetric representation of sigma has width pattern (1).
%e A342594 a(2) = 3 is the smallest odd prime whose symmetric representation of sigma has width pattern (1 0 1).
%e A342594 a(4) = 9 is the first number whose symmetric representation of sigma has width pattern (1 0 1 0 1). The infinitely many numbers 2^s * p^2, s >= 0 and p an odd prime larger than 2^(s+1), have the same width pattern.

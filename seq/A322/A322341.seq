%N A322341 The number of digits used in the sequence up to a(n) [a(n) included] is a multiple of a(n). The sequence starts with a(1) = 1 and is always extended with the smallest integer not yet present in the sequence that does not lead to a contradiction.
%C A322341 The sequence begins like A080676 but diverges from the 56th term on. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of A000027 (the positive integers): after computing 20000 terms, we see that the five smallest missing numbers are 2550, 2625, 3365, 3385 and 3399

%e A322341 a(1) = 1 as 1 digit is used so far [1] and a(1) is a multiple of 1;
%e A322341 a(2) = 2 as 2 digits are used so far [1 and 2] and a(2) is a multiple of 2;
%e A322341 a(3) = 3 as 3 digits are used so far [1, 2 and 3] and a(3) is a multiple of 3;
%e A322341 ...
%e A322341 a(10) is not equal to 10 as 11 digits would be used so far and 10 is not a multiple of 11;
%e A322341 a(10) = 11 as 11 digits are used so far [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1 and 1] and a(10) is a multiple of 11;
%e A322341 ...
%e A322341 a(56) = 26 as 104 digits are used so far [including a(56)] and 104 is a multiple of 26 (indeed 26*4 = 104);

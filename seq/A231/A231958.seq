%N A231958 Numbers n dividing the Lucas sequence u(n) defined by u(i) = 2*u(i-1) - 5*u(i-2) with initial conditions u(0)=0, u(1)=1.
%C A231958 All terms except 1 and 2 are divisible by 4. The sequence contains every nonnegative integer power of 2. There are infinitely many multiples of 12 in the sequence.

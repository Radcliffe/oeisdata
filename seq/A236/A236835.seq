%N A236835 Numbers that occur in more than one way as results of "downward" remultiplication (N -> GF(2)[X]) of some number.
%C A236835 Numbers that occur more than once in A234741.

%F A236835 For all n, A236379(a(n)) > 0.
%e A236835 5 occurs here, because it occurs in A234741 both as A234741(5)=5 and A234741(9)=5, as A048720(3,3)=5.
%e A236835 43 do not occur here, as although it is a term of A091209, it only occurs at A234741(43) as it cannot be obtained by other means as a carryless product than as 43 = A048720(3,25).

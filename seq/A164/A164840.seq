%N A164840 Right-truncatable squares: every prefix is square.
%C A164840 This sequence is finite and 169 is the last term. If there were to be another term, it must have three digits and contract to either 16 or 49; or have four digits and contract to 169. No such square exists. [_Sean A. Irvine_, Sep 08 2009]
%e A164840 a(6) = 169 since 169 is a perfect square and also 1 and 16 are perfect squares.
%t A164840 Select[Range[1000],Sum[Boole[IntegerQ[Sqrt[Floor[#/10^i]]]],{i,0,IntegerLength[#]-1}] == IntegerLength[#] &] (* _Stefano Spezia_, Jun 27 2025 *)

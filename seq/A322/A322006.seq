%N A322006 a(n) = number of primes of the form p = n - q, where q is a prime or semiprime.
%C A322006 Related to Chen's theorem (Chen 1966, 1973) which states that every sufficiently large even number is the sum of a prime and another prime or semiprime. Yamada (2015) has proved that this holds for all even numbers larger than exp(exp(36)).
%C A322006 In terms of this sequence, Chen's theorem with Yamada's bound is equivalent to say that a(2*n) > 0 for all n > 1.7 * 10^1872344071119348 (exponent ~ 1.8*10^15).
%C A322006 Sequence A322007(n) = a(2n) lists the bisection corresponding to even numbers only.
%C A322006 A235645 lists the number of decompositions of 2n into a prime p and a prime or semiprime q; this is less than a(2n) because p + q and q + p is the same decomposition (if q is a prime), but this sequence will count the two distinct primes 2n - q and 2n - p (if q <> p).

%e A322006 a(4) = 1 is the first nonzero term corresponding to 4 = 2 + 2 or, rather, to the prime 2 = 4 - 2.
%e A322006 a(5) = 2 because the primes 2 = 5 - 3 and 3 = 5 - 2 are of the required form n - q where q = 3 resp. q = 2 are primes.
%e A322006 a(6) = 2 because the primes 2 = 6 - 4 and 3 = 6 - 3 are of the required form n - q, since q = 4 is a semiprime and q = 3 is a prime.

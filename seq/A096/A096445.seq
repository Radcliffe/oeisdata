%e A096445 There are three reduced binary quadratic forms ax^2 + bxy +cy^2, notated as (a,b,c), with a discriminant of -36 (equivalent to determinant of 9): (1,0,9); (3,0,3); and (2,1,5). (3,0,3) is not primitive, because a, b, and c are not coprime. (1,0,9) and (2,1,5) are primitive, so there are two primitive reduced binary quadratic forms with a determinant of 9. 9 is 3^2, so a(3) = 2.
%Y A096445 Equals A096446(n^2). Cf. A006374.

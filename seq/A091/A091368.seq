%N A091368 Primes p such that the sum of the digits of p is not prime, but the sum of each digit raised to the 4th power is prime.
%C A091368 Apparently, for primes such that each digit raised to the 4th power sum to a prime, it is more likely that the digits themselves also sum to a prime. In the first 10,000 primes there are 760 primes whose digits raised to the 4th power sum to a prime. Of these, only 106 are such that the sums of the digits are not prime. Interestingly, all of these primes have a digit sum of 25 or 35. Essentially this sequence is the terms of A091367 (primes whose digits raised to the 4th power sum to a prime) that do not also appear in A046704 (primes whose digits sum to a prime).

%e A091368 a(1)=1699 because 1+6+9+9 = 25 which is not prime, but 1^4 + 6^4 + 9^4 + 9^4 = 14419 which is prime.

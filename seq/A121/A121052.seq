%N A121052 Smallest positive integer m for which n^m is congruent to 1 modulo n^2+n-1.
%C A121052 The sequence arises as the order of a shuffle of n(n+1) cards in which cards are laid out in an array of n+1 rows of n columns; cards are picked up by column and laid out by rows.
%C A121052 More generally there is a function of two variables, f(r,c) for which f(r,c) is the least integer such that c^f(r,c) is congruent to 1 modulo rc-1. Of interest is the ratio of phi(rc-1)/f(r,c) or in the case of the sequence proposed, phi(n^2+n-1)/m.
%C A121052 I would like to know if there is some direct way to predict these orders, or the ratio of phi(rc-1)/f(r,c). The program provided produces the table f(r,c).

%e A121052 a(2)=4 because 2^4=16=1 mod 5 but 2^1, 2^2 and 2^3 are not;
%e A121052 a(3)=5 because 3^5=1 mod 11 and 5 is the smallest such.

%N A371587 a(n) is the number of integers m from 1 to n inclusive such that m^m is a cube.
%C A371587 Dick Hess gave a puzzle at a "Gathering for Gardner" meeting asking for a(40).
%C A371587 a(n) is the number of integers not exceeding n that are divisible by 3 plus the number of cubes in the same range that are not divisible by 3.

%F A371587 a(n) = floor(n/3) + floor(n^(1/3)) - floor(n^(1/3)/3).
%e A371587 Suppose n = 40. There are 13 numbers in the range that are divisible by 3 and should be counted. In addition, there are two cubes 1 and 8 that are not divisible by 3. Thus, a(40) = 15.

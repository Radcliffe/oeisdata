%N A273129 The Rote-Fibonacci infinite sequence.
%C A273129 This is an aperiodic sequence that avoids the pattern x x x^R, where x is a nonempty block and x^R denotes the reversal of x.
%C A273129 It can be generated as the limit of the words R(i), where R(0) = 0, R(1) = 00, and R(n) = R(n-1)R(n-2) if n == 0 (mod 3), and R(n) = R(n-1) c(R(n-2)) if n == 1, 2 (mod 3), where c flips 0 to 1 and vice versa.
%C A273129 It can also be generated as the image, under the coding that maps a, b -> 0 and c, d -> 1, of the fixed point (see A316340), starting with a, of the morphism a -> abcab, b -> cda, c -> cdacd, d -> abc.
%C A273129 Theorem 1a of Du et al. (2016) basically says that this sequence is given by taking the Fibonacci word 01001010..., changing each 0 to a 2, and then using this as the run lengths of a binary word. - _Jeffrey Shallit_, Aug 29 2025

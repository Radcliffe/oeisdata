%N A146088 Numbers n with the property that shifting the rightmost digit of n to the left end doubles the number.
%C A146088 The sequence is infinite, since repeating 105263157894736842 any number of times (e.g. 105263157894736842105263157894736842) gives another number with the same property.
%C A146088 A number N = 10n+m is in the sequence iff 2N = m*10^d+n, where d is the number of digits of n = [N/10]. This is equivalent to 19n = m(10^d-2), i.e. 10^d=2 (mod 19) and n = m(10^d-2)/19, m=2..9 (to ensure that n has d digits). Thus for each d = 18j-1, j=1,2,3... we have exactly 8 solutions which are the j-fold repetition of one among {a(1),...,a(8)}. - _M. F. Hasler_, May 04 2009
%C A146088 Normally lists have offset 1, but there are good reasons to make an exception in this case. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Dec 24 2012

%F A146088 a(n) = ((10^d-2)/19*10+1)m, where m=(n-1)%8+2 is the trailing digit and d=(n+7)\8*18-1 is the number of other digits. - _M. F. Hasler_, May 04 2009
%F A146088 a(8k+i) = A217592(9k+i+1)/2 for i=1..8 with any k.
%e A146088 The sequence starts with a(0)=0 because rotating a lone 0 does double 0. That initial trivial term was not given an index of 1 when it was added, so that the index of other terms of A146088 would not change and invalidate delicate prior cross-references within OEIS (e.g., A217592) or outside of it.
%e A146088 a(4) = 263157894736842105 because 2*a(4) = 526315789473684210.

%N A246165 Permutation of natural numbers: a(1) = 1, a(n) = A064989(n)-th integer among those positive integers not occurring earlier in the sequence. [A064989(n) shifts the prime factorization of n one step right].
%C A246165 Terms at a(2^n) are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 32, 48, 71, 105, 156, 236, 354, 542, 815, 1228, ...
%C A246165 Fixed points begin as: 1, 2, 6, 10, 18, 42, 92, 26372, ...

%e A246165 By definition, a(1) = 1.
%e A246165 After that, for n = 2, when its prime factorization is shifted once right, results A064989(2) = 1, so we select the 1st of still unused positive natural numbers, which is 2, thus a(2) = 2.
%e A246165 For n = 3 = p_2 (3 is the second prime), when its prime factorization is shifted once right, results A064989(3) = 2 = p_1, so we select 2nd of still unused numbers, which is 4, thus a(3) = 4.
%e A246165 For n = 4, like for all powers of two, the result of right shifting is 1, so we select the smallest still unused number, which is 3, thus a(4) = 3.
%e A246165 For n = 5 = p_3, A064989(5) = 3 = p_2, so we select the 3rd smallest still unused number from [5, 6, 7, 8, ...] which is 7, thus a(5) = 7.

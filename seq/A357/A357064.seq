%N A357064 a(n) = k such that A091411(k) = A091409(n).
%C A357064 The existence of a(n) is proven in Lemma 1.2(a) of the article "The first occurrence of a number in Gijswijt's sequence". There, it is called t^{(1)}(n). In this article, a formula for the numbers t^{(m)}(n) is given. It looks like a tower of exponents and can be found in Theorem 6.20. This formula is then used to find a formula for the first occurrence of an integer n in Gijswijt's sequence, which is A091409(n).
%C A357064 The value of a(5) is calculated in Subsection 8.2 of the same article.
%C A357064 The value of a(6) is larger than 10^(10^100), so it would be impossible to include here.

%e A357064 For n=4 we have A091411(7)=A091409(4). Therefore, a(4)=7.

%N A275008 Decimal expansion of R/F, where R is the molar gas constant and F is Faraday's constant according to the 2019 SI system.
%C A275008 In eV/K.
%C A275008 This is the constant found in the Nernst equation: E = Eo + (R/F)*(T/n)*log(a_ox/a_rid), where Eo is the standard electric potential, E is the actual electric potential, T is the temperature, n is the amount of substance of transferred electron, a_ox is the activity of the oxidant and a_rid is the activity of the reductant.
%C A275008 From _Jianing Song_, Jul 06 2019: (Start)
%C A275008 The constants R and F have been updated according to the 2019 SI system.
%C A275008 As this constant can also be represented as 6903245/801088317 * 10^(-2) (see below), this sequence is purely periodic with period 778716. (End)

%N A018270 Divisors of 70.
%C A018270 This number has eight divisors which add up 144. Since that's more than twice 70, the number is abundant. However, 4 is not a divisor, nor can 4 be obtained from the smaller divisors (1 and 2), so there is only one way, the trivial way, to express 70 as a sum of distinct divisors. This is a sharp contrast to most abundant numbers. Hence 70 is a weird number (A006037). - _Alonso del Arte_, Oct 07 2017

%N A266118 a(n) = index of n in A266117 or 0 if n is not present in that sequence.
%C A266118 It is conjectured that A266117 is not just injective, but also surjective on N, i.e., that it is a true permutation of natural numbers. In that case also this sequence is a true permutation, and no hypothetical zero-values are ever needed.

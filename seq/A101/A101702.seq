%N A101702 Numbers m such that the sum of the factorials of their digits is equal to the reversal of m.
%C A101702 If s=sum of the factorials of digits of m & reversal(m) >= s then 10^(reversal(m) - s)*m is in the sequence. Example m=23; s = 2! + 3!; reversal(23) - s = 24 & 23*10^24 is in the sequence. So this sequence is infinite because there exist infinitely many numbers m such that reversal(m) > s. If m is a k-digit term of this sequence and the first digit of m is 1 then 10^(k-1) + m is also in the sequence. Examples: m=1 so 10^(1-1) + 1 = 2 is in the sequence, m=17927300 so 10^7 + 17927300 = 27927300 is in the sequence. If m > 5 then 10 divides a(m). If 10 doesn't divide a(m) then the reversal of m is in the sequence A014080, so all terms of A014080 are: reversal(1), reversal(2), reversal(541) & reversal(58504).
%e A101702 665100000 is in the sequence because reversal(665100000) = 1566 = 6! + 6! + 5! + 1! + 0! + 0! + 0! + 0! + 0!.

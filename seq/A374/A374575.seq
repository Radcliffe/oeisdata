%N A374575 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of distinct positive integers having the property that for any triple i,j,k of consecutive terms gcd(j,k) = 1 whereas A007947(i*j*k) is a term in A002110.
%C A374575 In other words a(n) is least k such that (j,k) = 1 and rad(i*j*k) is a primorial number (alternatively i*j*k is a term in A055932).
%C A374575 Conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers with primes in order.

%e A374575 Sequence starts with a(1,2,3) = {1,2,3} because this is the smallest consecutive triple of terms satisfying the definition ((2,3) = 1 and rad(1*2*3) = 6 = A002110(2)).
%e A374575 a(4) = 4 because (3,4) = 1, rad(2*3*4) = 6 = A002110(2), and 4 is the smallest unused number with this property.

%N A353125 a(1)=2. If a(n) is a novel term, a(n+1) = sopfr(a(n)), else if there are k occurrences of a(j)=a(n), (1<=j<=n), a(n+1)=k*a(n).
%C A353125 1 and 3 cannot be terms. Let conditions 1, 2 refer to the effects of a novel and repeat term respectively, and let M(m) be the multiplicity of m in the sequence. M(m) >= 2 for all m in N \ {1,3}. All first occurrences of a prime p > 2 follow a novel term in A046363 (by condition 1).
%C A353125 If the first occurrence of composite m arises from condition 1, then so does the second. Proof: Suppose not, then the second m must be a multiple w*t of a prior term t (condition 2); w >= 2. The term following the second m must be (w+1)*t, and this must equal 2*m (condition 2). Thus 2*w*t = (w+1)*t, so then w=1. But w >= 2; contradiction. Corollary: Once composite m has occurred by condition 1, then all subsequent occurrences of m occur the same way.
%C A353125 Most composite terms appear first by condition 2 (e.g., 12 as 2 copies of 6), and then subsequently by condition 1. Thus for all k in the sequence M(k) >= A000607(k), with equality when k is prime > 2, or certain composite numbers.
%C A353125 Conjecture: The 10 composite numbers 6,9,15,25,35,49,77,121,143,169 behave as primes in this sequence, namely for any such m, M(m) = A000607(m). For all other composite m, M(m) > A000607(m), i.e., at least one (up front) copy by condition 2.
%C A353125 The first occurrences of primes appear in natural order initially, but this is not sustained (e.g., 61 appears before 59).

%e A353125 a(1)=2, a novel term, so a(2)=sopfr(2)=2. 2 occurs twice and is the only prime p whose multiplicity is not A000607(p), simply because it is the seed term.
%e A353125 Since 2 has now appeared twice, a(3)=2*2=4, a novel term, so a(4)=sopfr(4)=4.
%e A353125 a(25)=24 (3 occurrences of 8), a(46)=24 (2 occurrences of 12). Subsequently all occurrences of 24 are from condition 1. Therefore M(24) = 2 + A000607(24) = 48.

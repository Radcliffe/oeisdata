%N A235032 Numbers which are factored to the same set of primes in Z as to the binary codes of irreducible polynomials in GF(2)[X].
%C A235032 This is a subsequence of the sequence which gives all such n that A001222(n) = A091222(n).

%e A235032 2, 3 and 11 are included in this sequence, because they occur in A091206. That is, they are all primes, and encode irreducible polynomials in ring GF(2)[X] via their binary representations: For 2, '10' in binary, corresponds to polynomial x, and for 3, '11' in binary, corresponds to polynomial x+1, and for 11, '1011' in binary, corresponds to polynomial x^3+x+1, which are all irreducible in GF(2)[X].
%e A235032 4 is included in this sequence, because it factors as 2*2, but also because the corresponding GF(2)[X] polynomial x^2 factors as x*x (with the polynomial x encoded by the number 2).
%e A235032 5 is NOT included in this sequence, because, although it is prime, the corresponding polynomial (5 in binary is '101'): x^2 + 1 is not irreducible in GF(2)[X], but factors as (x+1)(x+1), i.e., we have 5 = A048720(3,3).
%e A235032 111 is included, as it is a product of two primes, 3*37, and these primes encode via their binary representations, '11' and '100101', two polynomials irreducible in GF(2)[X]: x+1 and x^5 + x^2 + 1, whose product, x^6 + x^5 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1, is encoded by 111's binary representation, '1101111'.

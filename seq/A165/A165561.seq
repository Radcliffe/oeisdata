%N A165561 Primes that are the sum of an integer n and its arithmetic derivative
%C A165561 Some primes are the sum of an integer and its derivative in more than one way (e.g., 23, 71, 191 (not a complete listing within the range shown)). Just calculating this sequence from A165562 gives a list that is not sorted in ascending order and contains duplicate items. However, since in the range from 1 to 10000 only the number 1 and the primes have arithmetic derivatives that are less than their square roots, I feel confident that the list given above is not missing some term that corresponds to a large value in A165562. In other words, for a term to be missing from the list above, its corresponding value in A165562 would have to be less than 625. - _Alonso del Arte_, Oct 30 2009

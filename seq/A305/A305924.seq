%N A305924 Irregular table: row n >= 0 lists all k >= 0 such that the decimal representation of 4^k has n digits '0' (conjectured).
%C A305924 A partition of the nonnegative integers, the rows being the subsets.
%C A305924 Read as a flattened sequence, a permutation of the nonnegative integers.
%C A305924 In the same way, another choice of (basis, digit, base) = (m, d, b) different from (4, 0, 10) will yield a similar partition of the nonnegative integers, trivial if m is a multiple of b.
%C A305924 It remains an open problem to provide a proof that the rows are complete, in the same way as each of the terms of A020665 is unproved.
%C A305924 We can also decide that the rows are to be truncated as soon as no term is found within a sufficiently large search limit. (For all of the displayed rows, there is no additional term up to many orders of magnitude beyond the last term.) That way the rows are well-defined, but it is no longer guaranteed to have a partition of the integers.
%C A305924 The author finds "nice", i.e., appealing, the idea of partitioning the integers in such an elementary yet highly nontrivial way, and the remarkable fact that the rows are just roughly one line long. Will this property remain for large n, or else, how will the row lengths evolve?

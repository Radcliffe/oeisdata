%N A039725 Even abundant numbers divided by 2.
%C A039725 While the first even abundant number is 12 = 2^2*3, the first odd abundant is 945 = 3^3*5*7, the 232nd abundant number!
%C A039725 The asymptotic density of this sequence is in the interval (0.491096, 0.491156) (based on the known bounds on the densities of A005101 and A005231; see A302991 and A322287). - _Amiram Eldar_, Mar 11 2024

%F A039725 a(n) = A173490(n) / 2.
%e A039725 The first even abundant number is 12, so 12/2 = 6 is the first element in this sequence.

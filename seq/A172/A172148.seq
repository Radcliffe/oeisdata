%N A172148 Number of subsets S of {1,2,3,...,n} with the property that if x is a member of S then at least one of x/2 and 2x is also a member of S.
%C A172148 For the terms a(1) through a(25) is it seen that if n is odd then a(n)=a(n-1); also that if n is not a multiple of 4 then a(2n)=2a(2n-2). Does this behavior continue?

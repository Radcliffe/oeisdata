%N A337156 Numbers k such that the k-th triangular number has all its prime factors congruent to 1 mod 4.
%C A337156 The k-th triangular number t_k is given as t_k = k(k+1)/2. The t_k associated with this sequence form the intersection of A004613 and A000217.
%C A337156 Apart from 1, numbers whose prime factors are all congruent to 1 mod 4 are also known as primitive hypotenuse numbers because they are candidates for the hypotenuse of primitive right triangles.
%C A337156 For t_k to be a primitive hypotenuse number all its divisors must be congruent to 1 mod 4. Therefore k has to be odd and congruent to 1 mod 8.

%e A337156 a(2) = 25 because the 25th triangular number is 325, the prime factorization of 325 is 5^2*13, and 5,13 are both congruent to 1 mod 4. It is the second such occurrence.

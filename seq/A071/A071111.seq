%N A071111 a(n) is the least integer x such that there exists an integer in the open interval (x/(i+1), x/i) for i= n-1, n-2 ..., 3, 2, 1.
%C A071111 a(10) = 57, a(100) = 8191, a(1000) = 937993.
%C A071111 a(n) is the least integer that for k=1, 2, ..., (n-1) can be expressed as: a(n)=p*k + b for some positive integers p and b such that p>1 and p>b>0.
%C A071111 This is the same sequence (apart from the initial term) as A001000. The identity of these two sequences was first proved by Rustem Aidagulov and a detailed version of the proof can be found in the Alekseyev link below.
%C A071111 Comments from _Christopher Carl Heckman_, May 23 2004: "This problem was given in Crux Mathematicorum, Vol. 23 #6 (October 1997) as Problem #2272. A solution, which includes a general formula, can be found in Crux Mathematicorum, Vol. 24 #7 (November 1998): a(n) = floor (((n + x_n) / 2)^2 + 1), where x_n = floor (n + 1 - 2 sqrt (n - 1)).
%C A071111 "This formula was found by Florian Herzig (then a student at Cambridge, UK), who also proved that the proposer's conjecture that a(n) = cases (1 + (n-m)^2, if m^2 <= n - 2, 1 + (n-m)^2 + (n - m), otherwise) where m = floor ((1 + sqrt (4 n - 7)) / 2) also is true although 'the proof of this fact is quite challenging'.
%C A071111 "The problem was also solved by Peter Tingley (then an undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario), who gave the alternate formula: a(n) = n y_n + floor ((n - y_n)^2 / 4 + 1), where y_n = floor (n - 2 sqrt(n - 1) + 1), which 'is readily seen to be the same as the one obtained by Herzig.'"

%F A071111 For 2<=n<=200, a(n) = n^2 - n*c(n) + floor(c(n)^2/4) + 1, where c(n) = floor(sqrt(4n-5)). Is this true for all n>=2?
%e A071111 a(4)=7 because 2 lies in (7/4,7/3), 3 lies in (7/3,7/2) and 4, 5 and 6 lie in (7/2,7) and for x<7 the definition doesn't hold.

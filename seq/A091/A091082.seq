%N A091082 Numbers n which when converted to base 8, reversed and converted back to base 10 yield a number m such that n mod m = 0. Cases which are trivial or result in digit loss are excluded.
%C A091082 Trivial cases are those numbers which upon conversion result in a number which is palindromic (m = reverse(m)), or a palindrome plus trailing zeros such that m = reverse(m)*10^z where z=number of lost zeros. Nontrivial digit loss occurs when a converted number has trailing zeros that drop off when the number is reversed.

%e A091082 a(1) = 42 because: 42 in base 8 is 52; 52 reversed is 25; 25 converted back to base 10 is 21 and 42 mod 21 = 0.

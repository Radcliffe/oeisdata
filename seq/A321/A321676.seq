%N A321676 a(1)=1; for n > 1, a(n) is a(n-1) plus the number of vowels in the name of a(n-1) in US English.
%C A321676 This sequence takes into account the numbers written as words; for example, "fifty-seven" contains three vowels, so 3 is added to 57 to create the next term. The word "and" is not included in US English (cf. A158352), so 115 is written as "one hundred fifteen". This sequence is puzzling as it shares its first 6 terms with the odd numbers before jumping to 14, then 18. When only given the first 8 terms it can be very difficult to spot the rule.
%C A321676 Assumes "y" in e.g. "fifty" is not a vowel. - _Chai Wah Wu_, Dec 17 2018

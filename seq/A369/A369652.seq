%N A369652 Maximal digit in the primorial base representation of the n-th arithmetic derivative of 128.
%C A369652 This sequence relates to the question whether A327969(128) has a positive integer value, or whether it is -1 by the escape clause.
%C A369652 Note that when iterating the map k -> k' from A276086(A369638(4)) = A276086(15232) = 3299611946113357875 onward, the maximal exponent in the prime factorization (A051903) keeps on decreasing until it reaches 1 at the fifth iteration, and then stays as 1 for three more iterations (with k then 38863666759992439 = 643*60441161368573), but then, alas, on the next iteration, k' = 60441161369216 = 2^7 * 472196573197.

%F A369652 a(n) = A328114(A369638(n)).
%e A369652 The third arithmetic derivative (A099306) of 128 is 5056, which in primorial base (A049345) is written as 220220, therefore a(3) = 2.
%e A369652 The fourth arithmetic derivative (A258644) of 128 is 15232, which in primorial base is written as 663320, therefore a(4) = 6.

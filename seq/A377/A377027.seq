%N A377027 a(1) = 1. For n > 1, if a(n-1) is a novel term, a(n) = a(a(n-1)), and if a(n-1) seen k (>1) times (including a(n-1)), with k*a(n-1) < n then a(n) = k*a(n-1); else a(n) = 1.
%C A377027 The clause requiring a(n) = 1 if k*a(n-1) >= n is necessary to ensure continuation of the sequence, since without it there would be occasions of a(m) = a(a(m)) where a(m) is not yet defined, see Example. This is conjectured to occur infinitely many times as the sequence extends, which then implies that every positive integer will eventually enter the sequence (by incrementation of 1 if not before). Consequently every integer is conjectured to occur infinitely many times.

%e A377027 a(1) = 1 is a novel term so a(2) = a(a(1)) = a(1) = 1. Then a(3) = 2*1 = 2 because 1 has occurred twice. a(4) = a(a(2)) = a(2) = 1, and so on.
%e A377027 The first occasion of invoking the "a(n) = 1" clause is following a(32) = 32, a novel term so then a(33) = 32, whereupon (without the clause) we would have require a(34) = 64 then a(35) = a(a(64)), where a(64) is not yet defined. To avoid this we set a(34) = 1 so that the sequence may continue.

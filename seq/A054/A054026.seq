%N A054026 a(n) is the number of sets of natural numbers [a,b,c,d,e] that can be produced with the numbers [0..n] such that the values of all the distinct parenthesized expressions of a-b-c-d-e are different.
%C A054026 There are 14 ways to put parentheses in the expression a - b - c - d - e: ((a - (b - c)) - d) - e, (((a - b) - c) - d) - e, ((a - b) - (c - d)) - e, etc. This sequence describes how many sets of natural numbers [a,b,c,d,e] can be produced with the numbers {0,1,2,3,...,n} such that the values of all the distinct expressions are different.
%C A054026 It can be shown that in the set of expressions obtained this way, for any number of variables, a is always positive, b is always negative, and the other variables appear with every possible combination of signs. Therefore, the valid k-tuples of numbers in [0..n] are precisely those such that every subset of {c,d,e,...}, including the empty subset, has a distinct sum. For 5 variables, there are n*(n-1)*(n-2) ways to choose distinct, nonzero values for c, d, and e. For each k, there are floor((n-1)/2) ways to choose distinct numbers x and y in [0..n] such that x + y = k. Summing over all k in [0..n], allowing arbitrary permutations of {x,y,k}, and allowing a and b to be any value gives the formula below. - _Charlie Neder_, Jan 13 2019

%e A054026 For example, no such sets can be produced with only 0's, only 0's and 1's, only 0's and 1's and 2's, only 1's and 2's and 3's; with {0,1,2,3,4}, 300 such sets can be produced.

%N A357458 First differences of A325033 = "Sum of sums of the multiset of prime indices of each prime index of n.".
%C A357458 A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798. The multiset of multisets with MM-number n is formed by taking the multiset of prime indices of each part of the multiset of prime indices of n. For example, the prime indices of 78 are {1,2,6}, so the multiset of multisets with MM-number 78 is {{},{1},{1,2}}.
%F A357458 a(n) = A325033(n + 1) - A325033(n).
%e A357458 We have A325033(5) - A325033(4) = 2 - 0, so a(4) = 2.

%F A262695 If A262693(n) = 1 [when n is in A259934],
%F A262695   then a(n) = 0,
%F A262695 otherwise, if A060990(n) = 0 [when n is one of the leaves, A045765],
%F A262695   then a(n) = 1,
%F A262695 otherwise:
%F A262695   a(n) = 1 + Max_{k = A082284(n) .. A262686(n)} [A049820(k) = n] * a(k).
%F A262695 (In the last clause [ ] stands for Iverson bracket, giving as its result 1 only when A049820(k) = n, and 0 otherwise).
%e A262695 For n=1, its transitive closure (as defined by edge-relation A049820(child) = parent) is the union of {1} itself together with all its descendants: {1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8}. We see that there are no other nodes in this subtree whose root is 1, because A049820(3) = 3 - d(3) = 1, A049820(4) = 1, A049820(5) = 3, A049820(7) = 5, A049820(8) = 4 and of these only 7 and 8 are terms of A045765 (leaves). Starting iterating from 7 with A049820, we get 7 -> 5, 5 -> 3, 3 -> 1, and starting from 8 we get 8 -> 4, 4 -> 1, of which the former path is longer (3 steps), thus a(1) = 3+1 = 4.
%e A262695 For n=9, its transitive closure is {9, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 23, 24, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 36, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 64, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79}. In this case the longest path is obtained by starting iterating from the largest of these: 79 -> 77 -> 73 -> 71 -> 69 -> 65 -> 61 -> 59 -> 57 -> 53 -> 51 -> 47 -> 45 -> 39 -> 35 -> 31 -> 29 -> 27 -> 23 -> 21 -> 17 -> 15 -> 11 -> 9, which is 23 steps long, thus a(9) = 23+1 = 24.

%N A110312 Minimum number of polygonal pieces in a dissection of a regular n-gon into a square (conjectured).
%C A110312 I do not know which of these values have been proved to be minimal. (Probably only a(4)!).
%C A110312 Turning over is allowed. The pieces must be bounded by simple curves to avoid difficulties with non-measurable sets.
%C A110312 The three related sequences A110312, A362938, A362939 are exceptions to the usual OEIS policy of requiring that all terms in sequences must be known exactly. These sequences are included because of their importance and in the hope that someone will establish the truth of some of the conjectured values.
%C A110312 The definitions imply that A362938(n) <= A362939(n) <= a(n).
%C A110312 a(3)=4 is proved in Demaine et al. (2025).

%e A110312 a(3) <= 4 because there is a 4-piece dissection of an equilateral triangle into a square, due probably to H. Dudeney, 1902 (or possible C. W. McElroy - see Fredricksen, 1997, pp. 136-137). Surely it is known that this is minimal? See illustrations.
%e A110312 Coffin gives a nice description of this dissection. He notes that the points marked * are the midpoints of their respective edges and that ABC is an equilateral triangle. Suppose the square has side 1, so the triangle has side 2/3^(1/4). Locate B on the square by measuring 1/3^(1/4) from A, after which the rest is obvious. See the Sloane-Vaishampayan paper for another description of this construction, with coordinates.
%e A110312 a(4) = 1 trivially.
%e A110312 a(5) <= 6 since there is a 6-piece dissection of a regular pentagon into a square, due to R. Brodie, 1891 - see Fredricksen, 1995, p. 120. Certainly a(5) >= 5. Is it known that a(5) = 5 is impossible?
%e A110312 a(6) <= 5 since there is a 5-piece dissection of a regular hexagon into a square, due to P. Busschop, 1873 - see Fredricksen, 1995, p. 117. (See illustration.) Is it known that a(6) = 4 is impossible?
%e A110312 a(7) <= 7 since there is a 7-piece dissection of a regular heptagon into a square, due to G. Theobald, 1995 - see Fredricksen, 1995, p. 128. Is it known that a(7) = 6 is impossible?
%e A110312 a(8) <= 5 since there is a 5-piece dissection of a regular octagon into a square, due to G. Bennett, 1926 - see Fredricksen, 1995, p. 150. Is it known that a(8) = 4 is impossible?
%e A110312 a(9) <= 9 since there is a 9-piece dissection of a regular 9-gon into a square, due to G. Theobald, 1995 - see Fredricksen, 1995, p. 132. Is it known that a(9) = 8 is impossible?

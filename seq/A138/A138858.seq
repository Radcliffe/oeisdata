%N A138858 a(n) = least square such that the subsets of {a(1),...,a(n)} sum to 2^n different values.
%C A138858 Asking for 2^n different values implies that a(n) differs from all a(k), k<n and in view of the minimality condition, also that a(n) > a(n-1) for n>1.
%C A138858 Note that a(n) is close to, but not always larger than sum(a(k),k=1..n-1), as opposed to the case in A064934.
%e A138858 Up to a(4)=16, we have a(n)=n^2.
%e A138858 But since 5^2=25=9+16 is already represented as sum of earlier terms, this is excluded, while a(5)=6^2=36 has the required property.
%e A138858 Obviously, any square larger to the sum of all preceding terms leads to enough new terms, thus a(n) <= floor( sqrt( sum(a(k),k=1..n-1))+1)^2.
%e A138858 But in contrast to A064934, such a simple formula (with equality) cannot be used here:
%e A138858 a(7)=12^2=144 < 147=sum(a(k),k<7) and also a(10)=sum(a(k),k<10)-84.

%N A384183 a(n) = minimum number of steps required to move n stones from a hole to the next one in an infinite row of holes, where at one step we can move any k stones at once from a hole to the hole at distance k to the left or to the right, and there are n stones overall.

%e A384183 For n = 0 through n = 5, the fastest is to move n times 1 stone from the origin to the next hole.
%e A384183 For n = 6, one can move two times three stones three holes further, then three times two stones two holes "backwards", therefore a(6) = 2 + 3 = 5. Similarly, for a(3*4 = 12) = 3 + 4 = 7, and a(4*5 = 20) = 4 + 5 = 9. However, for larger oblong numbers, better solutions exist, and a(m*(m+1)) < 2m+1 for m > 4.

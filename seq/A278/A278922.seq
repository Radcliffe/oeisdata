%N A278922 Largest p such that n = p + q + r where p < q < r are all prime, or 0 if no such primes p, q, r exist.
%C A278922 Empirically, a(n) >= 2 for all n >= 18. Since a(2n) = 2 unless it is zero, the terms with even indices are less interesting, and the terms with odd indices are listed in A278923.
%C A278922 For even n, the existence of the three primes reduces to a slightly strengthened* variant of Goldbach's conjecture. For odd n, is a slightly strengthened* variant of the weak (a.k.a. odd, or ternary) Goldbach conjecture, considered to be proved since 2013. (*) In both cases, the strengthening consists of requiring that the three primes must be distinct.
%C A278922 From _Robert G. Wilson v_, Dec 02 2016: (Start)
%C A278922 The first occurrence of the n-th prime: 10, 15, 23, 31, 41, 49, 59, 71, 83, 97, 109, 121, 131, 143, 159, 173, 187, 199, 211, 223, 235, 251, 269, 287, 301, 311, 319, 329, 349, 371, 395, 407, 425, 439, 457, 471, 487, 503, ..., .
%C A278922 Conjecture: primes appear in their natural order. (End)

%F A278922 a(2n) = 2 (for n > 4), since one of the three primes must necessarily be even, and that can only be p = 2.
%F A278922 a(n) = 0 for n < 2 + 3 + 5 = 10, and for odd n < 3 + 5 + 7 = 15.

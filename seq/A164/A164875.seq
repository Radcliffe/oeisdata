%N A164875 Record holders for n^2 - phi(n)*sigma(n).
%C A164875 These numbers exhibit the largest differences between n^2 and sigma(n)*phi(n).
%C A164875 All of the differences are in A069249, and are guaranteed to be positive by Th. 329 in Hardy & Wright. The record differences are in A164876.

%e A164875 sigma(10) = 18; phi(10) = 4; 10^2 - sigma(10)*phi(10) = 28. This difference, 28, exceeds the difference for every smaller n, so 10 is in this sequence and 28 is in A164876.

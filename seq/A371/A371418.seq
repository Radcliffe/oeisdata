%N A371418 The largest aliquot divisor of the sum of divisors of n; a(1) = 1.
%C A371418 Carmichael (1921) defined this arithmetic function for the purpose of studying periodic chains that are formed by repeatedly applying the mapping x -> a(x) starting at a given positive integer. This results in a sequence that is analogous to an aliquot sequence.
%C A371418 Periodic chains of cycle 1 are the fixed points of this sequence. 1 and the even perfect numbers (the even terms of A000396) are fixed points. Are there any other numbers k such that a(k) = k?
%C A371418 If a(k) = k and k is even, then a(k) is even and so is sigma(k), and therefore sigma(k) = 2*k and k is an even perfect number. If k is odd, then it is an odd multiperfect number, and no odd multiperfect number above 1 is known.
%C A371418 More specifically, if a(k) = k and k is odd, then k must be a square, and an m-multiperfect number (number k such that sigma(k) = m * k), with m being an odd prime number that is the least prime factor of sigma(k). For example, if there is an odd triperfect number (A005820) then it is a fixed point of this sequence.
%C A371418 Periodic chains of cycle 2 are amicable pairs (A371419 and A371420). Are there any longer cycles?

%F A371418 a(n) = A032742(A000203(n)).
%F A371418 a(n) = A000203(n)/A071189(n).
%F A371418 a(n) = A000203(n)/2 if n is in A028983 (i.e., n is not in A028982).
%F A371418 a(k) = 1 if and only if k = 1 or k is in A023194.
%e A371418 The sum of the divisors of 3 is 1 + 3 = 4. The divisors of 4 are 1, 2, 4. 2 is the largest aliquot divisor of 4. Therefore a(3) = 2.

%N A056911 Odd squarefree numbers.
%C A056911 From _Daniel Forgues_, May 27 2009: (Start)
%C A056911 For any prime p, there are as many squarefree numbers having p as a factor as squarefree numbers not having p as a factor amongst all the squarefree numbers (one-to-one correspondence, both cardinality aleph_0).
%C A056911 E.g. there are as many even squarefree numbers as there are odd squarefree numbers.
%C A056911 For any prime p, the density of squarefree numbers having p as a factor is 1/p of the density of squarefree numbers not having p as a factor.
%C A056911 E.g. the density of even squarefree numbers is 1/p = 1/2 of the density of odd squarefree numbers (which means that 1/(p + 1) = 1/3 of the squarefree numbers are even and p/(p + 1) = 2/3 are odd). As a consequence the n-th even squarefree number is very nearly p = 2 times the n-th odd squarefree number (which means that the n-th even squarefree number is very nearly (p + 1) = 3 times the n-th squarefree number while the n-th odd squarefree number is very nearly (p + 1)/p = 3/2 the n-th squarefree number).
%C A056911 For any prime p, the n-th squarefree number not divisible by p is: n * (1 + 1/p) * zeta(2) + O(n^(1/2)) = n * (1 + 1/p) * (Pi^2 / 6) + O(n^(1/2)) (End)

%e A056911 The exponents in the prime factorization of 15 are all equal to 1, so 15 appears here. The number 75 does not appear in this sequence, as it is divisible by the square number 25.

%N A347383 Odd composites k, not powers of primes, such that for all their nontrivial unitary divisors d it holds that A347381(d) > A347381(k).
%C A347383 Here nontrivial unitary divisor d of k means any divisor d|k, such that 1 < d < k and gcd(d, k/d) = 1.
%C A347383 Any hypothetical odd term x in A005820 (triperfect numbers) would also be a member of this sequence. Proof: such an odd number cannot be a prime power (although it must be a square), thus it must have at least two nontrivial unitary divisors (with A034444(x) >= 4). Because sigma(x) = 3*x, it must be a term of A347391. From the illustration given there, we see that any odd square y in that sequence (i.e. with A347381(y)=1) would have an abundancy index of at least three (sigma(y)/y >= 3). But because abundancy index is multiplicative and always > 1 for n > 1, any nontrivial unitary divisor d of an odd triperfect number x must have sigma(d)/d < 3, thus for all such d, A347381(d) <> 1. And neither such divisor d can be a term of A336702, because 3*x is odd, therefore we must have A347381(d) > 1 for all nontrivial unitary divisors d of such a hypothetical x.
%C A347383 Any odd term of A000396, i.e., an odd perfect number, if such a hypothetical number exists, must also be a term of this sequence, by reasoning similar to above. See also illustration in A347392.

%e A347383 189 is a term, because A347381(189) = 1, and the only way to factor 189 into nontrivial unitary divisors is 7*27, and A347381(7) = A347381(27) = 3 > 1.
%e A347383 63767 = 11^2 * 17 * 31 is a term, as its nontrivial unitary divisors are [17, 31, 121, 527, 2057, 3751], at which points A347381 obtains values [6, 10, 5, 11, 6, 8], every one which is larger than A347381(63767) = 3.

%N A302503 Lexicographically first sequence of distinct terms such that any set of eight successive digits can be reordered as {d, d+1, d+2, d+3, d+4, d+5, d+6, d+7}, d being the smallest of the eight digits.
%C A302503 As the digit 0 has no predecessor and the digit 9 has no successor here, sets of successive digits like {6,5,4,3,2,1,0,9} and {3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0} are forbidden.

%e A302503 Terms a(1) to a(10) are obvious;
%e A302503 a(11) is 23 because 23 is the smallest integer not yet in the sequence such that the elements of the sets {3,4,5,6,7,8,9,2} and {4,5,6,7,8,9,2,3} are eight consecutive digits;
%e A302503 a(12) is 45 because 45 is the smallest integer not yet in the sequence such that the elements of the sets {5,6,7,8,9,2,3,4} and {6,7,8,9,2,3,4,5} are eight consecutive digits;
%e A302503 a(13) is 67 because 67 is the smallest integer not yet in the sequence such that the elements of the sets {7,8,9,2,3,4,5,6} and {8,9,2,3,4,5,6,7} are eight consecutive digits;

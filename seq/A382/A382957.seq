%N A382957 a(n) is the number of distinct numbers of intercalates extended self-orthogonal diagonal Latin squares of order n.
%C A382957 A self-orthogonal diagonal Latin square (SODLS, see A329685) is a diagonal Latin square orthogonal to its transpose. An extended self-orthogonal diagonal Latin square (ESODLS, see A309210) is a diagonal Latin square that has an orthogonal diagonal Latin square from the same main class. SODLS is a special case of ESODLS.

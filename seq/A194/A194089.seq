%N A194089 The number of labeled biconnected squaregraphs that contain n squares.

%e A194089 A biconnected squaregraph is "labeled" if one of the edges on its periphery is given an orientation. The a(2)=3 examples with n=2 are the domino together with two possible ways to orient one of the edges on its "long" side, and one way to orient an edge on the short side. If a squaregraph has m automorphisms and perimeter 2p, the number of different ways to label it is 4p/m.

%N A246272 Starting from n, the number of iterations of A003961 needed before the result has only prime factors of the form 4k+1 (a(1) = 0). [Where A003961(n) shifts the prime factorization of n one step towards larger primes].
%C A246272 Among the first 10000 terms, of which 4371 are primes, there are 92 distinct values in total (of which 23 are primes), the most common of them being: 1600 x 2, 1324 x 5, 1131 x 1, 1074 x 0, 571 x 4, 557 x 6, 538 x 9, 409 x 23, 404 x 3, 378 x 11, 211 x 8, 197 x 15, 131 x 12, 130 x 24, 128 x 49, 119 x 10, 95 x 7, 95 x 76, 92 x 22, 80 x 32, 70 x 14, 53 x 20, 47 x 77, 44 x 28, 29 x 17, 27 x 58, 24 x 21, 24 x 64, 23 x 13, 22 x 31, 22 x 39, 20 x 25, 19 x 48.
%C A246272 In contrast to A246271, here it holds that a(u) <= a(u*v) >= a(v) for any u, v. This follows because a number n has reached the "state of 4k+1 purity" (meaning that A065338(n) = 1) only if all its possible divisors have reached it as well.
%C A246272 This explains why for example 23 seems to be so common value. The reason is, that it occurs for the first time as a(30), and 30, being the third primorial is a product of three commonest primes: 30 = 2*3*5, thus for any n which is a multiple of 30, a(n) >= 23. Similarly a(42) = 49, a(84) = 49, a(126) = 49, so any number k which has 2, 3 and 7 as its prime factors must have a(k) >= 49.

%F A246272 If A065338(n) = 1, a(n) = 0, otherwise 1 + a(A003961(n)).
%F A246272 Other identities:
%F A246272 a(n) = a(A007947(n)) for all n. [Duplicate prime factors have no effect on the result].
%e A246272 Consider n = 6 = 2*3 = p_1 * p_2. Five is the least number of iterations of A003961(n) (which increments by one the prime indices of prime factorization of n), before both primes are of the form 4k+1:
%e A246272   p_2 = 3, p_3 = 5 (4k+3 & 4k+1),
%e A246272   p_3 = 5, p_4 = 7 (4k+1 & 4k+3),
%e A246272   p_4 = 7, p_5 = 11 (4k+3 & 4k+3),
%e A246272   p_5 = 11, p_6 = 13 (4k+3 & 4k+1),
%e A246272   p_6 = 13, p_7 = 17 (4k+1 & 4k+1),
%e A246272 thus a(6) = 5.

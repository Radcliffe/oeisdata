%N A236970 The number of partitions of n into at least 3 parts from which we can form every partition of n into 3 parts by summing elements.
%C A236970 The corresponding partitions with 2 in the definition instead of 3 are the complete partitions, which are counted by A126796.
%C A236970 The qualifier 'into at least 3 parts' is only relevant for n = 1 or 2. It is included because otherwise the condition would be vacuously true for all partitions of 1 and 2. It seems neater to consider that there are no partitions of 1 and 2 of this form.

%e A236970 The valid partitions of 5 are (2,1,1,1) and (1,1,1,1,1). Given any partition of 5 into 3 parts, it contains one part of at least 2. Therefore we can make any partition of 5 into 3 parts by joining (2,1,1,1) into three sums. (3, 1, 1) is not a valid partition, since (2,2,1) is a partition of 5 into 3 parts which cannot be made by summing elements from (3,1,1). Therefore a(5) = 2.

%Y A236970 Cf. A000041. A126796 is the case for 2 instead of 3, A236971 and A236972 are the cases for 4 and 5.

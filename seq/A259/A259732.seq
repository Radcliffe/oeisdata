%N A259732 Numbers n > 1 that divide ((p-1)/2)^3 + 2 for some odd prime p.
%C A259732 n = 3,5,10 works only once, for p=3 (3-1)/2=1, then 1^3 + 2 = 3 and for p=5 (5-1)/2=2, then 2^3+2 = 10.
%C A259732 This sequence is a subset of A057760, where all elements that are multiples of 3 and 5 are excluded, except the three above (3,5,10).
%C A259732 "Mirror sequence" of this one, when n divides ((p+1)/2)^3 - 2, p = prime, produces a sequence very close to this one, the only differences being 10 (excluded), 25 (included for p=5 (p+1)/2=3 then 3^3-2 = 25) and 6 (included for p=3 (p+1)/2=2 then 2^3-2 = 6).
%C A259732 Analyzing ((p-1)/2)^3 + 2 = (p^3 - 3(p(p-1)-5))/8, every composite x (mod 3) trying to divide this one will fail.
%C A259732 To prove 5 can't divide ((p-1)/2)^3 + 2 = (p^3 - 3p^2 + 3p + 15)/8 we use the last digit of p, which can be 1,3,7 or 9. This leads the last digit of the formula to be (1,9,7 or 3) + 15, so it cannot be divided by 5, unless the last digit of p is 5. This happens just for the only prime divisible by 5, i.e., 5 itself, which occurs only once.
%C A259732 A179871 looks very similar to this sequence.

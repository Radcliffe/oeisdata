%N A332089 Irregular table read by rows, where row n lists the lexicographically first superpermutation of minimal length over {1, ..., n}.
%C A332089 Sequence A180632 gives the row lengths and more information about superpermutations, i.e., strings over a finite alphabet that contain all permutations thereof as a substring.
%C A332089 In March 2014, Ben Chaffin showed that minimal superpermutations of order n = 5 have length 153, and found all 8 distinct superpermutations of this kind; the (non-palindromic) lexicographically first one is row 5 of this table. For n = 6, Robin Houston has found a few months later several superpermutations of length 872 (one less than the previously conjectured minimal length), but we still don't know which is the shortest (and/or lexico-first) superpermutation for that case.

%F A332089 For n < 5, row n results from row n - 1 by making the list of all substrings which are permutations, duplicating them and inserting (n) between the two copies, and merging them together again, with overlap reduced as much as possible.

%e A332089 One can consider an initial row 0 of length 0, producing row 1 as concatenation of (), (1), ().
%e A332089 Row 2 results from duplicating row 1 with (2) inserted in the middle.
%e A332089 Row 3 results from making the list of all permutations in row 2, ((1, 2), (2, 1)), then duplicating these and inserting (3), i.e.: ((1, 2, 3, 1, 2), (2, 1, 3, 2, 1)), then merging together with the second instance of the overlapping '2' removed in the middle.
%e A332089 Row 4 results in the same way from row 3, where the permutations are all length 3 substrings except for the middle (1, 2, 1).
%e A332089 Applying the same procedure to row 4 yields a superpermutation of {1, ..., 5} of minimal length 153 which is palindromic as the earlier ones, but not the lexicographically first one, which is given above.

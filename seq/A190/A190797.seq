%N A190797 For primes p and q=p+6 create primitive Pythagorean triangles with sides (q^2 - p^2)/2, (p^2 + q^2)/2, and p*q. If the two remainders of the middle and longest side modulo the shortest side are both prime, then p is in the sequence.
%C A190797 The short side is 6p+18, the middle side p^2+6p, the long side 6p+18+p^2.
%C A190797 The first few values have more terms == 3 (mod 4) than 1 (mod 4), but this does not appear to be the case for later terms. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, May 22 2011
%F A190797 If p=6k+5, then the remainders are 7 + 12*k and 25 + 12*k.
%F A190797 If p=6k+1, then the remainders are 7 + 24*k and 25 + 24*k.
%e A190797 For p=41 and q=47, the sides are (47^2 - 41^20)/2=264, 41*47=1927 and (41^2 + 43^2)/2=1945; divide 1927 and 1945 through 264 to get remainders 79 and 97.  Since both are primes, p=41 is in the sequence.

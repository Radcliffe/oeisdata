%N A186309 Numbers m having more than one representation as k*(1+phi(k)/2), where phi(k) is Euler's totient function.
%C A186309 The computations were provided by _Robert Israel_ from sci.math.  He found no m that had three representations up to k < 10^6.  It would be a challenge to find an m with three representations.

%e A186309 For 36, sum of the coprimes of 9 is 27, add to 9 to get 36; the sum of the coprimes of 12 is 24, add 12  to 24 to also get 36.  The corresponding {a,b} for each term is listed at the sci.math reference.

%N A141198 a(n) is the number of divisors of n that are each one more than a power of a prime.
%C A141198 1 is considered here to be a power of a prime. 0 is not considered here to be a power of a prime.

%e A141198 The divisors of 9 are 1, 3 and 9. 1 is one more than 0, not a power of a prime. 3 is one more than 2, a power of a prime. And 9 is one more than 8, a power of a prime. There are therefore 2 such divisors that are each one more than a power of a prime. So a(9) = 2.

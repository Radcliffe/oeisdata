%N A382256 Smallest binary number whose run lengths of bits correspond to a partition with Heinz number n.
%e A382256 Heinz number 1 corresponds to the empty product, empty sum and partition which is that of a(1) = 0.
%e A382256 Heinz number 2 = prime(1) corresponds to the partition (1), and run lengths of the binary number a(2) = 1 which has just one bit 1.
%e A382256 Heinz number 3 = prime(2) corresponds to the partition (2), which equals the run lengths of the binary number 11[2] = 3 = a(3) which has two consecutive bits 1.
%e A382256 Heinz number 4 = prime(1)^2 corresponds to the partition (1,1), which equals the run lengths of the binary number 10[2] = 2 = a(4) which has one bit 1, then one bit 0.
%e A382256 Heinz number 5 = prime(3)^2 corresponds to the partition (3), which equals the run lengths of the binary number 111[2] = 7 = a(5) which has three consecutive bits 1.
%e A382256 Heinz number 6 = prime(1)*prime(2) corresponds to the partition (1,2), which equals the run lengths of the binary number 100[2] = 4 = a(6).

%N A091078 Numbers n which when converted to base 4, reversed and converted back to base 10 yield a number m such that n mod m = 0. Cases which are trivial or result in digit loss are excluded.
%C A091078 Trivial cases are those numbers which upon conversion result in a number which is palindromic (m = reverse(m)), or a palindrome plus trailing zeros such that m = reverse(m)*10^z where z=number of lost zeros. Nontrivial digit loss occurs when a converted number has trailing zeros that drop off when the number is reversed.

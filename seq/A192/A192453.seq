%N A192453 Numbers k such that -1 is a 4th power mod k.
%C A192453 Complement of A192452. Subsequence of A008784. A further reduction to 8th powers yields 1, 2, 17, 34, 97, 113, 193, 194, ...
%C A192453 From _Jianing Song_, Mar 31 2019: (Start)
%C A192453 k is a term if and only if k is not divisible by 4 and all odd prime factors are congruent to 1 modulo 8. If k is a term of this sequence, then so are all divisors of k.
%C A192453 Decompose the multiplicative group of integers modulo k as a product of cyclic groups C_{s_1} x C_{s_2} x ... x C_{s_m}, where s_i divides s_j for i < j, then k is a term iff s_1 is divisible by 8. For k = 1 or 2, (Z/kZ)* is the trivial group, s_1 does not exist so 1 and 2 are also terms. This is an analog of A008784 (where s_1 is divisible by 4) and A319100 (where s_1 is divisible by 6). (End)

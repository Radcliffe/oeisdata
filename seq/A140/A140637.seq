%N A140637 Number of unlabeled graphs of positive excess with n nodes.
%C A140637 We can find in "The Birth of the Giant Component" p. 53, see the link, the following: "The excess of a graph or multigraph is the number of edges plus the number of acyclic components, minus the number of vertices."
%C A140637 If G has just one complex component with 4 nodes, the "non-complex part" of G can be,
%C A140637 a) One forest of order 4. There are 6 forests, so 2*6=12 graphs.
%C A140637 b) One triangle and one isolated vertex, or 2*1=2 graphs.
%C A140637 c) One unicyclic graph of order 4, so 2*2=4 graphs.
%C A140637 Also the number of unchoosable unlabeled graphs with up to n vertices, where a graph is choosable iff it is possible to choose a different vertex from each edge. The labeled version is A367867, covering A367868, connected A140638. - _Gus Wiseman_, Feb 13 2024

%F A140637 a(n) = A000088(n) - A134964(n).
%e A140637 Below we show that a(8) = 12073. Note that A140636(n) is the number of connected graphs of positive excess with n nodes.
%e A140637 Let G be a disconnected graph of positive excess with 8 nodes. In this case, G has one or two complex components. We have 3 graphs of order 8 with two complex components. One of those graphs is depicted in the figure below:

%e A140637 If G has one complex component with 5 nodes, the non-complex part of G can be,
%e A140637 a) One forest of order 3. There are 3 forests, so A140636(5) * 3 = 39 graphs.
%e A140637 b) One triangle, so A140636(5) = 13 graphs.
%e A140637 If G has one complex component with 6 nodes, the non-complex part of G is a forest of order 2. There are 2 forests. We have A140636(6) * 2, or 186 graphs.
%e A140637 If G has one complex component with 7 nodes, the non-complex part of G is one isolated vertex. We have A140636(7), or 809 graphs.
%e A140637 Finally if G is connected, we have A140636(8), or 11005 graphs.
%e A140637 The total is 3 + 12 + 2 + 4 + 39 + 13 + 186 + 809 + 11005 = 12073.

%N A192544 Bases b such that all integers m having the commuting property r(m)^2 = r(m^2), where r is cyclic replacement of digits d->(d+1) mod b, are of the form m = (b/2 - 1)*(b^k - 1)/(b - 1) + 1 for k >= 1.
%C A192544 The bases b form the arithmetic sequence 8+4*k, k>=0, so b/2 is necessarily even. The bases b=2 and b=4 have b/2 as the only number with the commuting property. No odd base b has the commuting property.

%F A192544 From _Chai Wah Wu_, Dec 29 2021: (Start)
%F A192544 a(n) = 2*a(n-1) - a(n-2) for n > 2.
%F A192544 G.f.: x*(8 - 4*x)/(x - 1)^2. (End)
%e A192544 In base 8, the numbers with the commuting property are 4, 34, 334, 3334, 33334, 333334 etc, given by the formula 3*(8^k - 1)/7 + 1.

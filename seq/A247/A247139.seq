%N A247139 The number of tilings of a triangular shape T_n with n rectangles identifying all tilings which use the same rectangular shapes.
%C A247139 The triangular shape T_n has here row length k for row k, for k = 1, 2, ..., n. Consider tilings of T_n with n rectangular shapes (i,j),(i < j, i > j, i=j (square)). The number of possible rectangular shapes (i,j) with n >= i >= j >= 1, which can show up at all in the tiling of T_n (together with their transposed shapes with i interchanged with j) is given as A002620(n+1). See the Dec 09 2014 comment and example by _Wolfdieter Lang_ there.
%C A247139 The number of such tilings is equal to A000108(n) (Catalan numbers). See the examples in the Catalan number link. For each tiling there is a transposed tiling obtained by mirroring w.r.t. the antidiagonal (SW-NE). A tiling may be self-transposed. E.g., n = 4 has transposed pairs a, m; b, h; x, i; c, g; d, j; e, k; and f, e. Tiling a is (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), tiling m is then (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1). [There is a bijection with binary trees. - _Ludovic Schwob_, Mar 23 2025]
%C A247139 For the present sequence not only the transposed tilings are identified but all other tilings with the same rectangular shapes irrespective of the order in (i,j). Thus, in the Catalan link a and m and d and j and e and k and f and e are all identified. E.g., tiling j has tiles (4,1), (1,3), (1.2), (1,1) which is, by taking (1,3) as (3,1), and (1,2) as (2,1) the same as tiling a. Tilings c and g are identified with tiling b. Therefore, for n=4 there remain only 3 tilings with representatives a, b and x given in the link. They represent 8, 4 and 2 tilings, respectively.

%C A247139 a(n) is the number of binary trees with n internal nodes up to isomorphism (up to exchange of left and right children of each internal node) and up to exchange of subtrees with the same number of nodes. Isomorphic binary trees are equivalent, but the converse is not true:

%e A247139 The total number is 5 = A000108(5) (Catalan).
%e A247139 T3 is identified with T1 by taking (1,3) as (3,1) and (1,2) as (2,1). Similarly, T4 and T5 are also identified with T1. Representatives are T1 and T2, representing 4 and 1 tilings,respectively. Therefore a(3) = 2.

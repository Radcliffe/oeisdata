%N A277622 Integers such that the first part "a", divided by the penultimate digit "b", leaves the last digit "c" as remainder (see the Example section for a detailed explanation).
%C A277622 There are 8991 terms < 100000.

%e A277622 Consider the first term, 110: the part "a" is "1", the penultimate digit "b" of "110" is "1" and the last digit "c" of "110" is "0"; we see indeed that 1/1 leaves a remainder of 0.
%e A277622 Consider the second term, 121: we see indeed that 1/2 leaves a remainder of 1 -- but no term between 110 and 121 has the same property (117, for instance, doesn't fit because 1/1 has 0 as remainder -- and not 7 as it should have to be part of the sequence).
%e A277622 Similarly, the integer 1983 is part of the sequence because 19/8 leaves a remainder of 3.

%N A349169 Numbers k such that k * gcd(sigma(k), A003961(k)) is equal to the odd part of {sigma(k) * gcd(k, A003961(k))}, where A003961 shifts the prime factorization one step towards larger primes, and sigma is the sum of divisors function.
%C A349169 Numbers k such that A348990(k) [= k/gcd(k, A003961(k))] is equal to A348992(k), which is the odd part of A349162(k), thus all terms must be odd, as A348990 preserves the parity of its argument.
%C A349169 Equally, numbers k for which gcd(A064987(k), A191002(k)) is equal to A000265(gcd(A064987(k), A341529(k))).
%C A349169 Also odd numbers k for which A348993(k) = A319627(k).
%C A349169 Odd terms of A336702 are given by the intersection of this sequence and A349174.
%C A349169 Conjectures:
%C A349169   (1) After 1, all terms are multiples of 3. (Why?)
%C A349169   (2) After 1, all terms are in A104210, in other words, for all n > 1, gcd(a(n), A003961(a(n))) > 1. Note that if we encountered a term k with gcd(k, A003961(k)) = 1, then we would have discovered an odd multiperfect number.
%C A349169   (3) Apart from 1, 15, 105, 3003, 13923, 264537, all other terms are abundant. [These apparently are also the only terms that are not Zumkeller, A083207. Note added Dec 05 2024]
%C A349169   (4) After 1, all terms are in A248150. (Cf. also A386430).
%C A349169   (5) After 1, all terms are in A348748.
%C A349169   (6) Apart from 1, there are no common terms with A349753.
%C A349169 Note: If any of the last four conjectures could be proved, it would refute the existence of odd perfect numbers at once. Note that it seems that gcd(sigma(k), A003961(k)) < k, for all k except these four: 1, 2, 20, 160.
%C A349169 Questions:
%C A349169   (1) For any term x here, can 2*x be in A349745? (Partial answer: at least x should be in A191218 and should not be a multiple of 3). Would this then imply that x is an odd perfect number? (Which could explain the points (1) and (4) in above, assuming the nonexistence of opn's).

%N A235199 Self-inverse and multiplicative permutation of integers: For n < 4, a(n)=n, a(5)=7 and a(7)=5, a(p_i) = p_{a(i)} for primes with index i > 4, and a(u * v) = a(u) * a(v) for u, v > 0.
%C A235199 The permutation satisfies A000040(a(n)) = a(A000040(n)) for all positive n except n=3 or 4, and is self-inverse. It swaps 5 & 7, maps all larger primes p_i (with index i > 4) to p_{a(i)}, and lets the multiplicativity take care of the rest.
%C A235199 It can be viewed also as a "signature-permutation" for a bijection of non-oriented rooted trees, mapped through Matula-Goebel numbers (cf. A061773). The bijection will swap the subtrees encoded by primes 5 and 7, wherever they occur as the terminal branches of the tree:

%C A235199 .x...............x..
%C A235199 .5...............7..
%C A235199 That is, any branch which ends at least in three edges long unbranched stem, will be changed so that its last two edges will become V-branch. Vice versa, any branch of the tree that ends with three edges in Y-formation, will be transformed so that those three edges will be straightened to an unbranching stem of three edges.
%C A235199 This permutation commutes with A235201, i.e. a(A235201(n)) = A235201(a(n)) for all n.
%C A235199 Permutation fixes n! for n=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 and 9.
%C A235199 Note also that a(5!) = a(120) = 168 = 120+(2*4!) and a(10!) = 5080320 = 3628800+(4*9!).

%F A235199 For n < 4, a(n)=n, a(5)=7 and a(7)=5, a(p_i) = p_{a(i)} for primes with index i > 4, and a(u * v) = a(u) * a(v) for u, v > 0.

%N A134601 Composite numbers such that the square mean of their prime factors is a prime (where the prime factors are taken with multiplicity and the square mean of c and d is sqrt((c^2+d^2)/2)).
%C A134601 All perfect prime powers (A025475) with power > 0 are included.
%C A134601 Originally, the definition started with "Nonprime numbers ..." and the first term was equal to 1. This is misleading, since 1 has no prime factors. - _Hieronymus Fischer_, Apr 20 2013

%e A134601 a(5) = 25, since 25=5*5 and sqrt((5^2+5^2)/2)=5;
%e A134601 a(13) = 119, since 119=7*17 and sqrt((7^2+17^2)/2)=sqrt(169)=13.

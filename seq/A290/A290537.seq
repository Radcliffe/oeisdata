%N A290537 Let S be the sequence generated by these rules: 0 is in S, and if z is in S, then z + 1 and z * (1+i) are in S (where i denotes the imaginary unit), and duplicates are deleted as they occur; a(n) = the imaginary part of the n-th term of S.
%C A290537 See A290536 for the real part of the n-th term of S and additional comments.
%C A290537 See A290538 for the square of the norm of the n-th term of S.

%e A290537 S(1) = 0 by definition; so a(1) = 0.
%e A290537 S(1)+1 = 1 has not yet occurred; so S(2) = 1 and a(2) = 0.
%e A290537 S(1)*(i+i) = 0 has already occurred.
%e A290537 S(2)+1 = 2 has not yet occurred; so S(3) = 2 and a(3) = 0.
%e A290537 S(2)*(1+i) = 1+i has not yet occurred; so S(4) = 1+i and a(4) = 1.
%e A290537 S(3)+1 = 3 has not yet occurred; so S(5) = 3 and a(5) = 0.

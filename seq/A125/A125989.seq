%N A125989 Sum of heights of 10's in binary expansion of n.
%C A125989 The 'height' of the digits in the binary expansion of n is here defined by the algorithm where, starting from the least significant bit and the height=0 and proceeding leftwards, all encountered 1-bits decrease the height by one and all 0-bits increase it by one. The sequence gives the sums of heights at the positions where 0 changes to 1 when scanning the binary expansion from right to left. This sequence is used for computing A126302.
%e A125989 E.g. the lattice path /\/\ is encoded by 10 as 1010 in binary and both peaks occur at height=1, thus a(10)=2.
%e A125989 In comparison, 11 is 1011 in binary, so the only peak '10' occurs at height -1:
%e A125989 .../
%e A125989 /\/
%e A125989 thus a(11)=-1.

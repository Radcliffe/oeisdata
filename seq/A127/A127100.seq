%N A127100 Numbers k such that k^2 divides 10^k-1.
%C A127100 Subsequence of A014950.
%C A127100 First 7 terms are palindromes. a(n) is divisible by 3 for 1<n<10. 3^2 divides a(n) for n = {3,5,6,7,9}. 37 divides a(n) for n = {4,5,7,8,9}. Prime factors of a(n) are {3,37,333667,2028119,...}. Note that a(3)/a(2) = a(5)/a(4) = a(9)/a(8) = 3 and a(7)/a(6) = 37. - _Alexander Adamchuk_, Jan 25 2007
%C A127100 Except for 3, also numbers n such that the decimal expansion of 1/n^2 has period n. - _Arkadiusz Wesolowski_, Mar 13 2012

%N A122241 Iterates of A122237, starting from 4.
%C A122241 It might be more natural to use offset 0 for the initial value a(0) = 4 since that's not the result of an actual iteration of the map A122237. However, some other sequences (A122242, A179845, A179841, ...?) depend on this and have b-files that would require to be changed. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jul 18 2025

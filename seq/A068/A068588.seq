%N A068588 Treated as strings, n and its reversal are substrings of 2^n.
%C A068588 For an arithmetical function f whose range is a set of integers, call n a "fixated point" of f if, treated as strings, n and its reversal are both substrings of f(n). a(n) above lists the fixated points of f(n) = 2^n. In general, the faster f(n) grows with respect to n, the more digits f(n) will have as compared with n, hence the likelier it is to contain n and n' as substrings. Thus it is more interesting to consider f(n) which grows slowly with respect to n. One such function is given by f(n) = Prime(n). The only fixated points of f not exceeding 107 are 7 and 6460. Are there any more such points?

%N A373798 Divide A374965 into "blocks" by saying that each prime term ends a block; sequence gives lengths of successive blocks.
%C A373798 The first 286 terms of the sequence are the result of dividing the first 10000 terms of A374965 into "blocks."
%C A373798 Comment from _N. J. A. Sloane_, Aug 09 2024 (Start):
%C A373798 Suppose p = A374965(t) is a prime in A374965, and is the s-th prime to appear there (that is, A375028(s) = p and A373799(s) = t). The next term in A374965 is by definition A374965(t+1) = prime(t+1) - 1 = r (say). Then the block starting with r has length a(s+1) = A050412(r) + 1. For example, p = 19 = A374965(5) is the second prime in A374695, so we have s = 2, t = 5, and r = prime(6) - 1 = 13 - 1 = 12. Then A050412(12) = 3, which tells us that a(3) = 3 + 1 = 4. The block is [12, 25, 51, 103].
%C A373798 For a larger example, the s = 285th prime in A374965 is p = 160077823 = A374965(7686), so t = 7686. The next block begins with r = prime(7687) - 1 = 78282. After 39 steps of double-and-add-1 (corresponding to A050412(78282) = 39) we reach the 286th prime in A374965, A374965(7726) = 43036534378594303. (End)

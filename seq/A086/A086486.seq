%e A086486 30 is a member. The prime divisors of 30 are 2, 3 and 5 and 2+3+5 = 10, divides 30.
%e A086486 84, however, is not a member because the sum of its distinct prime divisors (2+3+7=12) does not divide the product of its distinct prime divisors (2*3*7=42), even though 12 does divide 84. - _Harvey P. Dale_, Nov 26 2011, based on a comment from _Ray Chandler_

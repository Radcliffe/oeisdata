%N A178751 Numbers k such that in Z/kZ the equation x^y + 1 = 0 has only the trivial solutions with x == -1 (mod k).
%C A178751 It appears that odd terms 3, 15, 51, 255, 771, 3855, 13107, 65535, ... are given by A038192. - _Michel Marcus_, Aug 08 2013
%C A178751 This is the complement of A126949 in the numbers k > 1. (But it could be argued that the sequence should start with k = 1 as initial term.) It appears that for any a(j) in the sequence, 2*a(j) is also in the sequence. The primitive terms (not of the form a(j) = 2*a(m), m < j) are 2, 3, 15, 20, 51, 68, 255, 340, 771, 1028, .... (see A274003). - _M. F. Hasler_, Jun 06 2016

%e A178751 In Z/3Z, the only solution to the equation x^y + 1 = 0 is x = 2 and y = 1. Whereas in Z/5Z, the equation has at least one nontrivial solution: 2^2 + 1 = 0.

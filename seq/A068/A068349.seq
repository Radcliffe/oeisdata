%N A068349 Numbers k having a partition k=Sum x_i for which Product k/x_i is also a way of factoring k.
%C A068349 From _Charles L. Hohn_, Apr 02 2025: (Start)
%C A068349 Equivalent to: numbers with at least 1 factorization for which the sum of the reciprocals of the factors equals 1, e.g. a(5) = 36: 2 * 3 * 6 = 36 and 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 = 1. The first few terms with record counts of such factorizations are: 432 (2: {2, 6, 6, 6} and {3, 3, 4, 12}), 43200 (3), 110592 (4), 115200 (6), 518400 (7).
%C A068349 A000312(k) = k^k for k >= 1 is a subsequence, as all terms factor to k k's, and k*(1/k) = 1. (End)
%e A068349 36 is in the sequence because 36 has a partition 18+12+6 for which (36/18)*(36/12)*(36/6)=2*3*6 is also a way of factoring 36.
%e A068349 324 is in the sequence since 54+54+108+108=324 and (324/54)*(324/54)*(324/108)*(324/108)=3*3*6*6=324.

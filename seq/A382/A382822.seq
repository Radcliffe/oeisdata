%N A382822 If a(n-1) is odd, then a(n) is the smallest even integer not yet in the sequence; if a(n-1) is even, then a(n) = a(n-1)/2 if this number is not in the sequence, otherwise a(n) = 3*a(n-1)/2; a(1)=1.
%C A382822 Less repetitive than A350877 (the Sisyphus sequence); presumably a permutation of the positive integers.
%C A382822 Fixed points are 1, 2, 3, 4, 20, 38, 40, 44, 58, 74, 76, 86, 88, 92, 106, ,,., which, aside from 3, all seem to be even.
%C A382822 Largest runs of even terms seem to be of length 6, the first one of which appears at a(62)=64.
%Y A382822 Cf. A350877.

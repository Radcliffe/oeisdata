%N A092920 Number of strongly monotone partitions of [n].
%C A092920 A partition is strongly monotone if its blocks can be written in increasing order of their least element and increasing order of their greatest element, simultaneously.
%C A092920 a(n) is the number of strongly nonoverlapping partitions of [n] where "strongly nonoverlapping" means nonoverlapping (see A006789 for definition) and, in addition, no singleton block is a subset of the span (interval from minimum to maximum) of another block. For example, 13-24 is nonnesting and 14-23 is strongly nonoverlapping but neither has the other property. The Motzkin number M_n (A001006) counts strongly noncrossing partitions of [n]. - _David Callan_, Sep 20 2007
%C A092920 Strongly monotone partitions can also be described as partitions in which no block is contained in the span of another, where span denotes the interval from smallest to largest entries. For example, 134/25/6 is strongly monotone but 135/24/6 is not because the block 24 is contained in the interval [1,5]. - _David Callan_, Aug 27 2014

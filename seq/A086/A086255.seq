%N A086255 a(n) is the first prime for which floor(a(n)/p) is prime for all p among the first n primes.
%C A086255 a(n) represents the first prime which meets the requirements described above. All later a(n+m) also meet the requirements of a(n). For a given n there may be many later primes which also satisfy the same requirements of a(n).
%e A086255 a(5) = 21436799 because 21436799 is the first prime for which floor(21436799/j) is prime when j has any of the values 2,3,5,7, or 11 (the first 5 primes). So 21436799 is allowed because floor(21436799/2) = 10718399, floor(21436799/3) = 7145599, floor(21436799/5) = 4287359, floor(21436799/7) = 3062399 and floor(21436799/11) = 1948799 and all of these values (10718399, 7145599, 4287359, 3062399 and 1948799) are primes.

%N A384230 Number of subparts in the central part of the symmetric representation of sigma(n).
%C A384230 The diagram called "symmetric representation of sigma(n)" was discovered in 2014 after the sequence A236104 which arises from A196020.
%C A384230 The diagram can be dissectioned in layers of width 1. Before the dissection the polygons of the diagram are called "parts". The number of parts gives A237271. For further information about the "parts" see A237270.
%C A384230 Since the diagram is symmetric if the diagram has an odd number of parts so the diagram has a central part and the correspondent row of A237270 has an odd number of terms.
%C A384230 Otherwise if the diagram has an even number of parts so the diagram has no central part and the correspondent row of A237270 has an even number of terms.
%C A384230 The diagrams for the numbers A174973 have only one part so they have only one central part.
%C A384230 The numbers whose diagram has a central part are in A071562.
%C A384230 The numbers whose diagram has no central part are in A071561.
%C A384230 After the dissection of the diagram in layers of width 1 all polygons are called "subparts". The "subparts" were defined in A279387.
%C A384230 For an algorithm for calculating subparts see A280850 and then A296508 and A280851.
%C A384230 A237271 also gives the number of subparts in the first layer of the diagram.
%C A384230 A001227 gives the total number of subparts in the diagram.
%C A384230 Every line segment of the diagram has a meaning within Partition Theory, as explained in A235791 and A237591
%C A384230 For a relationship with a theorem of correspondence between the partitions of n into k consecutive parts and the odd divisors of n see A379630.
%C A384230 The diagram also can be represented with free polyominoes (A000105).
%C A384230 The diagram is essentially the same as the terraces of a stepped pyramid described in A245092. For reach the pyramid see the following order: A196020, A236104, A235791, A237591, A237593 and A245092.
%C A384230 The pyramid emerges as a pop-up polyhedron from a template which looks like an "isosceles triangle" described in A237593 (it would be nice to have an animation of the Pop-Up pyramid).
%C A384230 A237593 also can be represented as the Dyck paths. In a quadrant of the sqaure grid two successive Dyck paths form the diagram of the symmetric representation of sigma(n). The representation with Dyck paths is related to the top view of the pyramid.
%C A384230 The pyramid is related to many topics such as geometry, symmetry, compositions, partitions, divisors, convolutions, Dyck paths, Pop-Up polyhedra, polycubes, polyominoes, and posibly more.
%C A384230 Also the pyramid seems to be an unified geometric pattern related to Number Theory since it shows the exact position of the terms of several tens of sequences as for example: prime numbers (A000040), sigma function (A000203), aliquot parts (A001065), Chowla's function (A048050), powers of 2 (A000079), triangular numbers (A000217), hexagonal numbers (A000384), perfect numbers (A000396), Mersenne primes (A000668), etc. For further sequences that we can find in the pyramid see the Crossrefs section of A262626.
%C A384230 For a relationship with the partition numbers (A000041) see the prism and the tower in A221529 and in the Links section here.
%C A384230 The volume of the tower gives A066186 which is also the convolution of A000203 and A000041. The volume of the pyramid gives A175254 which is also the convolution of A000203 and A000027. Any convolution of sigma (A000203) with another sequence of positive integers can be represented with polycubes of this family.
%C A384230 For further information about the correspondence between divisors and parts of partitions and the tower see A338156 and A340035.
%C A384230 This sequence shares infinitely many terms with A067742 from which first differs at a(18). It also shares with A067742 the positions of zeros and nonzeros.
%C A384230 For the positive terms a(n) = A067742(n) if and only if all subparts in the central part lies on the axis of symmetry of the diagram.
%C A384230 Observation: consider the sublists of divisors of n whose terms increase by a factor of at most 2. At least for the first 88 terms a(n) coincides with the number of odd divisors in the central sublist of divisors of n. For more information see A384225.

%F A384230 a(n) = 0 if and only if A067742(n) = 0.
%F A384230 a(n) >= A067742(n).
%F A384230 (a(n) - A067742(n)) is an even number.
%e A384230 For n = 6 the 6th row of A237270 is 12 so the central part of the symmetric representation of sigma(6) is also 12.
%e A384230 On the other hand the 6th row of A237593 is [4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4] and the 5th row of the same triangle is [3, 2, 2, 3] therefore between both symmetric Dyck paths there are only one part has shown below in the figure 1.
%e A384230 On the other hand after A196020 and the algorithm of A280850 we have that:
%e A384230 The 6th row of A196020 is [11, 0, 1].
%e A384230 The 6th row of A280850 is [11, 0, 1].

%e A384230 The 6th row of A280851 is [11, 1].
%e A384230 Therefore the central part contains two subparts as shown below in the figure 2.

%e A384230     there is only one              there are two "subparts"
%e A384230    "part" of area [12]          of areas [11, 1] respectively
%e A384230     so A237271(6) = 1.                   so a(6) = 2.
%e A384230 .
%e A384230 For n = 15 the 15th row of A237270 is [8, 8, 8] so the central part of the symmetric representation of sigma(15) is 8.
%e A384230 On the other hand the 15th row of A237593 is [8, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8] and the 14th row of the same triangle is [8, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 8] therefore between both symmetric Dyck paths there are three parts has shown below in the figure 3.
%e A384230 On the other hand after A196020 and the algorithm of A280850 we have that:
%e A384230 The 15th row of A196020 is [29, 13, 7, 0, 1].

%e A384230 .
%e A384230 For n = 45 the 45th row of A237270 is [23, 32, 23] so the central part of the symmetric representation of sigma(45) is 32.
%e A384230 On the other hand the 45th row of A237593 is [23, 8, 5, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 5, 8, 23] and the 44th row of the same triangle is [23, 8, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 23] therefore between both symmetric Dyck paths there are three parts: [23, 32, 23]. The two equidistant parts are two bars each of area 23 and the central part has area 32.
%e A384230 On the other hand after A196020 and the algorithm of A280850 we have that:

%e A384230 There are six subparts.
%e A384230 The central part has four subparts as shown below in the figure 6.

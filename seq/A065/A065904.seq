%N A065904 Integers i > 1 for which there is one prime p such that i is a solution mod p of x^4 = 2.
%C A065904 Solutions mod p are represented by integers from 0 to p-1. The following equivalences holds for i > 1: There is a prime p such that i is a solution mod p of x^4 = 2 iff i^4 - 2 has a prime factor > i; i is a solution mod p of x^4 = 2 iff p is a prime factor of i^4 - 2 and p > i. i^4 - 2 has at most three prime factors > i. For i such that i^4 - 2 has no resp. two resp. three prime factors > i; cf. A065903 resp. A065905 resp. A065906.

%F A065904 a(n) = n-th integer i such that i^4 - 2 has one prime factor > i.
%e A065904 a(3) = 4, since 4 is (after 2 and 3) the third integer i for which there is one prime p > i (viz. 127) such that i is a solution mod p of x^4 = 2, or equivalently, 4^4 - 2 = 254 = 2*127 has one prime factor > 4 (cf. A065902).

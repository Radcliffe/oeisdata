%N A134942 Numbers m such that there exists no number k with k-P(k) = m, where P(k) is the product of digits of k written in base 10.
%C A134942 Obviously no number containing a zero digit is in the sequence.

%e A134942 For 0 <= p <= 9, p - P(p) = 0, hence 0 is not in the sequence.
%e A134942 It's easy to see that if p has 2 digits or more the difference p - P(p) has at least 2 digits, hence 1 to 9 are in the sequence.

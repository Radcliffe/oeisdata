%N A374717 For n a power of 2, a(n) = n. Otherwise let k = n - 2^j (> 0) where 2^j is the greatest power of 2 not exceeding n, then a(n) = least novel m*a(k); m a term in A033844.
%C A374717 Definition developed from the Doudna recursion A005940, see Example. Conjectured to be a permutation of A318400, numbers whose prime factorization consists only of primes with indices 2^k (terms in A033844).
%C A374717 From _David James Sycamore_, Aug 09 2024: (Start)
%C A374717 The even bisection when divided by 2 returns the sequence. The odd bisection when transformed by replacing all factors prime(2^k) in a(2*n-1) with prime(2^(k-1)) also returns the sequence (similar to properties of A005940). The sequence is fixed on numbers of the form 2^n or 3*2^n (A029744), since by the definition points at 2^n are already named as such, and if n = 3*2^r then the powers of 2 adjacent to n are 2^r < 2^(r+1) < 3*2^r < 2^(r+2), from which, by the definition we find k = 2^(r+2) - 3*2^r = 2^r(3 - 2) = 2^r, which is a fixed point so a(k) = 2^r, and a(n) is least novel m*a(k); m a term in A033844. Since 2^r is already a term the required m is 3, so a(n) = 3*2^r = n (compare with fixed points of A005940). (End)
%C A374717 Definition analogous to the Name of A005940: Let c_i = number of 1's in binary expansion of n-1 that have i 0's to their right, and let p(j) = j-th prime. Then a(n) = Product_i p(2^i)^c_i. - _Michael De Vlieger_, Aug 09 2024

%F A374717 a(2^k) = 2^k, a(3*2^k) = 3*2^k.
%F A374717 a(2^k-1) = 3^(k-1), k >= 1; a(2^k+1) = A033844(k+1); k >= 0.
%e A374717 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2 because both are powers of 2. a(3) = 3 since for n = 3, k = 1, a(1) = 1 and m = 3. a(4) = 4 because 4 is a power of 2
%e A374717 For a(5), k = 1, a(1) = 1 and therefore a(5) = 1*7 since 7 is least term in A033844 not already used.
%e A374717 Whereas the Name defines each individual term recursively, the following procedure describes a recursion for generating the first 2^k terms from the first 2^(k-1) terms: Let S(0) = {1}, and then S(k) = {2*S(k-1), S(k-1)}, where 2*S(k-1) means twice every term in S(k-1). Thus from
%e A374717        S(0) = {1} we obtain:
%e A374717        S(1) = {2,1},
%e A374717        S(2) = {4,2,2,1},
%e A374717        S(3) = {8,4,4,2,4,2,2,1},
%e A374717        S(4) = {16,8,8,4,8,4,4,2,8,4,4,2,4,2,2,1} etc.
%e A374717 Convert these (indices) to primes as follows:
%e A374717        P(0) = {2},
%e A374717        P(1) = {3,2},
%e A374717        P(2) = {7,3,3,2},
%e A374717        P(3) = {19,7,7,3,7,3,3,2},
%e A374717        P(4) = {53,19,19,7,19,7,7,3,19,7,7,3,7,3,3,2}, etc.
%e A374717 Set U(0) = 1 and U(k) = U(k-1)*P(k-1) prepended by U(k-1), thus:
%e A374717        U(0) = {1},
%e A374717        U(1) = {1,2},
%e A374717        U(2) = {1,2,3,4},
%e A374717        U(3) = {1,2,3,4,7,6,9,8},
%e A374717        U(4) = {1,2,3,4,7,6,9,8,19,14,21,12,49,18,27,16}, etc.
%e A374717 Thus U(k) gives the first 2^k terms of the sequence because the primes in P(k) are the greatest prime factors of the corresponding terms.

%e A374717 Using the alternative binary definition:
%e A374717 For n = 9, n-1 = 1000_2; c_3 = 1, hence a(9) = prime(2^3)^1 = 19.
%e A374717 For n = 10, n-1 = 1001_2; c_0 = 1, c_2 = 1; a(10) = prime(2^0)^1 * prime(2^2)^1 = 2*7 = 14.
%e A374717 For n = 11, n-1 = 1010_2; c_1 = 1, c_2 = 1; a(11) = prime(2^1)^1 * prime(2^2)^1 = 3*7 = 21.
%e A374717 For n = 12, n-1 = 1011_2; c_0 = 2, c_1 = 1; a(12) = prime(2^0)^2 * prime(2^1)^1 = 2^2*3 = 12.
%e A374717 For n = 13, n-1 = 1100_2; c_2 = 2; a(13) = prime(2^2)^2 = 7^2 = 49.
%e A374717 For n = 2^k + 2^(k-1) = 3*2^(k-1), n-1 = 2^(k+1) - 2^(k-1) - 1.
%e A374717   c_0 = k-1, c_1 = 1, therefore we have fixed point a(3*2^(k-1)) = 3*2^(k-1). (End)

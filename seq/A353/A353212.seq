%N A353212 Hadwiger number of the n-path complement graph.
%C A353212 A contraction in the complement of any set of paths reduces the total number of edges in the complement by at most 4. This gives an upper bound for the Hadwiger number which is obtainable for all path lengths except 4 and 5. In particular, for n >= 6, the complement of a P_n reduces to the complement of a P_{n-4} union 3 universal nodes by contracting the second and second to last nodes of the path. With P_8 and P_9 the 2nd and 6th nodes should be contracted (instead of reducing to P_4 or P_5 respectively). - _Andrew Howroyd_, Jun 18 2025

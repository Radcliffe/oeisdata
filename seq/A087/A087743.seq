%N A087743 Numbers m >= 3 with property that the remainder when m is divided by k (for 3 <= k <= m-2) is not 1.
%C A087743 More generally, let prime_Y consist of the numbers n >= 2+Y which never yield a remainder of Y when divided by any number from 2+Y to n-Y-1. Prime_0 are the usual primes, A000040. This sequence gives prime_2.
%F A087743 P[n, Y] = P[n-1, Y] for most terms where P is a Boolean array of numbers n and Y their order of primeness: if P[n, Y] then n is a prime of order Y

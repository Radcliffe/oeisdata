%N A088787 Numbers which are primes and which remain prime for three successive applications of incrementing each digit by 2 with carries ignored.
%C A088787 Imagine that each digit of n is on a wheel on a combination lock and each wheel is being rotated two notches for each application of the function. Thus for the digits 0 to 7, the replacement digit is simply the digit+2, but for 8 the replacement digit is 0 and for 9 the replacement digit is 1. Thus 227 -> 449 -> 661 -> 883 -> 5 (initial zeros are dropped on results.)
%e A088787 a(3)=227 because (i) 227 is prime and (ii) incrementing each digit of 227 by 2 yields 449 which is prime and (iii) incrementing each digit of 449 by 2 (ignoring carries) yields 661 which is prime and (iv) incrementing each digit of 661 by 2 yields 883 which is prime

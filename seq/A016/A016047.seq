%N A016047 Smallest prime factor of Mersenne numbers 2^p-1, where p is prime.
%C A016047 "Mersenne numbers", here, means A001348. Compare to sequence A049479, where "Mersenne numbers" is used in the sense of A000225. - _Lekraj Beedassy_, Jun 11 2009
%C A016047 Submitted new b-file withdrawing last three terms previously submitted.  I had, before submitting that b-file, checked that the smallest known factors of incompletely factored Mersenne numbers was less than the known trial factoring limits recorded by Will Edgington in his LowM.txt file which can be found on his Mersenne page, (see link above.)  I have now discovered that I inadvertently omitted the purported a(203) from that check. - _Daran Gill_, Apr 05 2013
%C A016047 The would-be a(203) corresponds to 2^1237-1 which is currently P70*C303. Trial factoring has only been done to 60 bits, and since its difficulty doubles whenever the bit length is incremented by one, it cannot exhaustively search the space smaller than the sole known 70-digit (231-bit) factor. Probabilistic ECM testing indicates only that it is extremely unlikely that there is any undiscovered factor with digit-size smaller than the high fifties. See GIMPS links. - _Gord Palameta_, Aug 16 2018

%N A360692 a(0) = 0. Thereafter a(n+1) = a(a(n)) if a(n) has not occurred previously, otherwise a(n+1) = n - 1 - a(n-1).
%C A360692 An inductive argument shows that a(n) <= n for all n, with equality iff n = 0. It follows that a(n) is well defined, and the sequence is infinite.
%C A360692 Apart from a(1) = 0 every repeat term is followed by a novel term, and vice versa.
%C A360692 Every nonnegative integer appears infinitely many times.
%C A360692 The proper subsequence given by a(2*k) for k >= 2 is the sequence itself, which is therefore fractal.
%C A360692 Starting from a(1) = 0 the sequence is the nonnegative integers interleaved with itself.

%F A360692 a(2*n + 1) = n for all n >= 0.
%F A360692 A027383(n) = 0. (n >= 0) gives the positions of all zeros after a(0) = 0.
%F A360692 a((2*k + 3)*2^n - 2) = k (n >= 0) gives the positions of all k > 0.
%F A360692 The number of nonnegative terms occurring between consecutive zeros is 0,0,1,1,3,3,7,7,15,15,... (A000225(n), repeat).
%F A360692 a(n) = A101279(n+2) - 1. - _Rémy Sigrist_, Feb 18 2023
%e A360692 a(0) = 0 is a novel term so a(1) = a(a(0)) = 0. Since a(1) is a repeat term a(2) = 0 - a(0) = 0 - 0 = 0. a(1,2) = 0,0 is the only case of consecutive repeat terms.
%e A360692 Since a(2) = 0 is a repeat term, a(3) = 1 - a(1) = 1 - 0 = 1, a novel term so a(4) = a(a(1)) = 0, and so on.
%e A360692 a(16) = 3, a repeat term (last seen at a(7)), so a(17) = 15 - a(15) = 15 - 7 = 8.

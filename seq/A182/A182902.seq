%N A182902 Number of valleys in all weighted lattice paths in B(n).
%C A182902 The members of B(n) are paths of weight n that start at (0,0), end on but never go below the horizontal axis, and whose steps are of the following four kinds: an (1,0)-step with weight 1, an (1,0)-step with weight 2, a (1,1)-step with weight 2, and a (1,-1)-step with weight 1. The weight of a path is the sum of the weights of its steps. A valley is a (1,-1)-step followed by a (1,1)-step.

%e A182902 a(7) = 4. Indeed, denoting by h (H) the (1,0)-step of weight 1 (2), and U = (1,1), D = (1,-1), among the 82 paths in B(7) only hUDUD, UDUDh, UDUhD, and UhDUD have valleys (1 in each).

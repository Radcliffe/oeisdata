%N A337191 If cards numbered 1 through n are "Down Two Table" shuffled (top two put on bottom one at a time, third from top card dealt to table) until all of the cards are placed on the table, a(n) is the number of the last card dealt.
%C A337191 This sequence is related to the Josephus Problem, which can be modeled with the Australian Under Down Shuffle, one card placed under the deck, one card laid down on the table until all the cards are on the table.
%C A337191 This might be an erroneous version of A054995. - _Tanya Khovanova_, Mar 04 2025

%F A337191 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1, a(n) = (a(n-2) + 3) (mod n) if (a(n-2) + 3) (mod n) is not 0; a(n) = n if (a(n-2) + 3) (mod n)=0.
%F A337191 Any number n can be written as either 2*(3^k) + 2m (where 0 <= m < 3^k, k = 0,1,2,...) or 3^k + 2m (where 0 <= m < 3^k, k = 0,1,2,...), in either case a(n) = 3m + 1.
%e A337191 Suppose we have two cards in order 1,2. Both of them are dealt to the bottom, then card 1 is dealt to table. Thus, the last card is 2 and a(2) = 2, which contradicts. - _Tanya Khovanova_, Mar 04 2025

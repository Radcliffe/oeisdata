%N A109018 Least number with exactly n prime factors counted with multiplicity which gives a different number with exactly n prime factors counted with multiplicity when digits are reversed.
%C A109018 An emirp ("prime" spelled backwards) is a prime whose (base 10) reversal is also prime, but which is not a palindromic prime. The first few are 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, 97, 107, 113, 149, 157, ... (A006567).
%C A109018 An emirpimes ("semiprime" spelled backwards) is a semiprime whose (base 10) reversal is a different semiprime. A list of the first emirpimeses (or "semirpimes") are 15, 26, 39, 49, 51, 58, 62, 85, 93, 94, 115, 122, 123, ... (A097393).
%C A109018 An "emirp tsomla-3" ("3-almost prime" spelled backwards) is the k=3 sequence of the series for which k=1 are emirps and k=2 are emirpimes, a list of these being A109023. The union of these for k=1 through k = 13 is A109019.
%C A109018 The primes correspond to the "1-almost prime" numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ... (A000040). The 2-almost prime numbers correspond to semiprimes 4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, ... (A001358).
%C A109018 The first few 3-almost primes are 8, 12, 18, 20, 27, 28, 30, 42, 44, 45, 50, 52, 63, 66, 68, 70, 75, 76, 78, 92, 98, 99, ... (A014612). The first few 4-almost primes are 16, 24, 36, 40, 54, 56, 60, 81, 84, 88, 90, 100, ... (A014613).
%C A109018 The first few 5-almost primes are 32, 48, 72, 80, ... (A014614).
%C A109018 The Mathematica code for this was written by _Ray Chandler_, who has coauthorship credit for this sequence.

%e A109018 a(1) = 13 because 13 is the smallest "emirp" (prime which, digits reversed, becomes a different prime) since reverse(13) = 31 is prime.
%e A109018 a(2) = 15 because 15 is the smallest emirpimes ("semiprime" spelled backwards) as a semiprime whose (base 10) reversal is a different semiprime. The first such number is 15, since 15 reversed is 51 and both 15 and 51 are semiprimes (i.e. 15 = 3 * 5 and 51 = 3 * 17).
%e A109018 a(3) = 117 because 117 is the smallest "emirp tsomla-3" ("3-almost prime" spelled backwards) since 117 reversed is 711 and 117 = 3^2 * 13 and 711 = 3^2 * 79.

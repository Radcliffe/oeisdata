%N A358267 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2. Thereafter:(i). If no prime divisor of a(n-1) divides a(n-2), a(n) is the least novel multiple of the squarefree kernel of a(n-1). (ii). If some (but not all) prime divisors of a(n-1) do not divide a(n-2), a(n) is the least of the least novel multiples of all such primes. (iii). If every prime divisor of a(n-1) also divides a(n-2), a(n) = u, the least unused number.
%C A358267 Let a(n-2) = i, a(n-1) = j. The sequence is generated from divisor relationships j->i, ranging from coprime: gcd(i,j) =1, to partial: 1 < gcd(i,j) < j, to total: gcd(i,j) = j, using conditions described in the definition.
%C A358267 The first 26 terms are the same as those of A280864 and A280866.
%C A358267 A prime cannot occur consequent to condition (i). a(n) = prime p either because p|a(n-1) but not a(n-2); see (ii), or because every prime divisor of a(n-1) also divides a(n-2), as when for example a(n-1) is a prime power q^k and q|a(n-2), which forces a(n) = u prime, see (iii).
%C A358267 If a(n) = u = p from condition (iii), a(n+1) = 2*p. If p|a(n-1)-> a(n) = p we see m*p->p->u (and u may of course be prime, as in ...,13,17,...). 13 is the first prime to appear consequent to condition (ii), see Example. Consecutive primes appear often: (13,17); (53,59); (61,67); ... Sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers with primes appearing slowest, and in natural order.
%C A358267 Local minima consist of 1 and the primes p, while 4p dominates the maxima as n increases. - _Michael De Vlieger_, Nov 06 2022

%e A358267 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2 and since 2|a(2) but not a(1), and no other primes are involved, a(3) = 4, the least novel multiple of 2, the squarefree kernel of 2 (by (i)).
%e A358267 Every prime divisor of a(3) = 4 also divides a(2) = 2, thus a(4) = 3, the least unused number (by (iii)).
%e A358267 a(23) = 13 because 13|a(22) = 26, but does not divide a(21) = 28 (by (ii)). Then since every prime divisor of a(23) also divides a(22), a(24) = 17, the least unused term (by (iii)). This is the first occasion of consecutive primes.
%e A358267 a(25) = 34, a(26) = 30 and there are two primes (3,5) which divide 30 but not 34. At this point the least novel multiples of 3 and 5 are 27 and 25 respectively, so a(27) = 25 (by (ii)). This is the first departure from A280864/A280866, which both have a(27) = 45.

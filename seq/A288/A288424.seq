%N A288424 Partial sums of A288384.
%C A288424 It appears that the number of zeros is infinite.
%C A288424 Observation: for at least the first 110 terms the largest distance between two zeros that are between nonzero terms is 3.
%C A288424 Question: are there distances > 3?
%C A288424 From _Hartmut F. W. Hoft_, Jun 13 2017: (Start)
%C A288424 Yes: a(346..351) = (0,1,2,3,4,0).
%C A288424 Conjecture: a(n) >= 0 for all n >= 0, and a(n) is unbounded.
%C A288424 First occurrences: 3 = a(337) occurring 27 times; 4 = a(350) occurring 8 times; 5 = a(830) occurring 5 times; all through n=2500. (End)

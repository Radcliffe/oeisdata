%N A359874 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2. For n > 2, a(n) is the least novel power of the greatest prime divisor of a(n-2) + a(n-1).
%C A359874 In other words, a(n) is the least novel number p^k, where p is the greatest prime divisor of a(n-2) + a(n-1) and k >= 1. All terms are prime powers, though it is not known if every such number appears. Primes to the first power do not occur in natural order (e.g., 43 precedes 29).

%e A359874 a(3) = 3 because a(1) + a(2) = 3, and no power of 3 has yet appeared.
%e A359874 a(4) = 5 because a(2) + a(3) = 5, and no power of 5 has yet appeared.
%e A359874 a(15) = 121 because a(13) + a(14) = 33 which has greatest prime divisor 11. But 11^1 has already occurred at a(8), so the least novel power of 11 is 11^2 = 121.

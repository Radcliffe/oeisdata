%e A385755 All primes p are in the sequence, because they are characterized by the pair [b,s] = [bigomega=1, sopfr=p], and no other numbers have this pair.
%e A385755 All even semiprimes 2*p are terms, because no other number can have [b,s]=[2,p+2]. p+2 is odd, and odd semiprimes p*q would have even s.
%e A385755 20 with [b,s]=[3,2+2+5] and 27 with [b,s]=[3,3+3+3] are not in the sequence, because both have [b,s]=[3,9].
%e A385755 21 and 25 are not in the sequence, because both have [b,s]=[2,10].
%e A385755 36 is in the sequence as it is the only number having [4, 10]. - _David A. Corneth_, Jul 11 2025

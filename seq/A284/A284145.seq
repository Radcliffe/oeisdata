%N A284145 Triangle read by rows T(n,k) in which each term is the least positive integer not yet appearing in the triangle that is coprime to all the terms in its associated row, column, diagonal and antidiagonal.
%C A284145 Conjecture 1: The triangle is a permutation of the natural numbers.
%C A284145 Let F(k) and G(n) be the set of prime factors of all terms in a given column k or diagonal n (diagonal n originates at T(n,1)).
%C A284145 Conjecture 2: Each F(k) and G(n) is a permutation of the prime numbers (except F(1) and G(1), which obviously also contain 1).
%C A284145 Let S be a set of terms whose members have certain specified characteristics (e.g., even numbers or prime numbers). Sets S whose members appear in due course in ascending order include:
%C A284145 (a) Prime numbers (so 2 appears first, followed by 3, 5, 7, 11, ...);
%C A284145 (b) Numbers which have exactly the same prime factors (so for example: {6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 54, 72, ...} appear ascending order because their prime factors are {2,3});
%C A284145 (c) Powers of prime(j), because they are a subcategory of (b) (so for example: 5 appears first, followed by 25, 125, 625, 3125, ...).

%e A284145 T(7,4) = 35 because terms with prime factor 2 already appear in the diagonal (and column), and terms with prime factor 3 already appear in the diagonal (and antidiagonal) to T(7,4); no terms with prime factors 5 or 7 appear in any row, column, diagonal or antidiagonal to T(7,4); and terms 5, 7, and 25 already appear in the triangle.

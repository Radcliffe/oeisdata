%N A266191 Sequence beginning with a(1)=1, a(2)=2, a(3)=3 and then after each new term a(n) is selected as the least unused number for which a(n)*a(n-1)*a(n-2) is a fibbinary number (A003714), i.e., has no adjacent 1's in its base-2 representation.
%C A266191 It is conjectured that this sequence is not only injective, but also surjective on N, i.e., that it is a true permutation of natural numbers.

%e A266191 For n=4, we start testing from the least so far unused number, which is 4, by multiplying it by a(3)*a(2) = 6. Because 6*4 = 24, which has two adjacent 1's in its binary representation "11000", 6 is disqualified. Next we try 5, and 6*5 = "11110", and 5 is also disqualified. Next we try 6, and 6*6 = "100100", with no adjacent 1's, and we have found the least unused number satisfying the required condition, thus we set a(4) = 6.

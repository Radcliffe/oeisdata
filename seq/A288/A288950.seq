%N A288950 Number of relaxed compacted binary trees of right height at most one with empty initial and final sequence on level 0.
%C A288950 A relaxed compacted binary tree of size n is a directed acyclic graph consisting of a binary tree with n internal nodes, one leaf, and n pointers. It is constructed from a binary tree of size n, where the first leaf in a post-order traversal is kept and all other leaves are replaced by pointers. These links may point to any node that has already been visited by the post-order traversal. The right height is the maximal number of right-edges (or right children) on all paths from the root to any leaf after deleting all pointers. The number of unbounded relaxed compacted binary trees of size n is A082161(n). The number of relaxed compacted binary trees of right height at most one of size n is A001147(n). See the Genitrini et al. and Wallner link. - _Michael Wallner_, Apr 20 2017
%C A288950 a(n) is the number of plane increasing trees with n+1 nodes where node 3 is at depth 1 on the right of node 2 and where the node n+1 has a left sibling. See the Wallner link. - _Michael Wallner_, Apr 20 2017

%F A288950 From _Seiichi Manyama_, Apr 26 2025: (Start)
%F A288950 a(n) = (n-1)*(2*n-3)/(n-2) * a(n-1) for n > 3.
%F A288950 a(n) = A001879(n-2)/3 for n > 2. (End)
%e A288950 Denote by L the leaf and by o nodes. Every node has exactly two out-going edges or pointers. Internal edges are denoted by - or |. Pointers are omitted and may point to any node further right. The root is at level 0 at the very left.
%e A288950 The general structure is
%e A288950   L-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o
%e A288950     |       |     | |
%e A288950     o   o-o-o   o-o o.
%e A288950 For n=0 the a(0)=1 solution is L.
%e A288950 For n=1 we have a(1)=0 because we need nodes on level 0 and level 1.
%e A288950 For n=2 the a(2)=1 solution is
%e A288950      L-o
%e A288950        |
%e A288950        o
%e A288950 and the pointers of the node on level 1 both point to the leaf.
%e A288950 For n=3 the a(3)=2 solutions have the structure
%e A288950      L-o
%e A288950        |
%e A288950      o-o
%e A288950 where the pointers of the last node have to point to the leaf, but the pointer of the next node has 2 choices: the leaf of the previous node.

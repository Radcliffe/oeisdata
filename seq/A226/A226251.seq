%N A226251 Concatenated cyclical sequence starting from Fibonacci sequence.
%H A226251 <a href="/index/Rec#order_10">Index entries for linear recurrences with constant coefficients</a>, signature (0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1).
%F A226251 Start with the Fibonacci sequence 0,1,1,2,3,5,8; at this point rewrite the next term 13 as 1,3 and continue adding: 1,3,4,7. At this point rewrite the sum 11 as 1,1 and the sequence will recur if values greater than or equal to 10 are rewritten as two single-digit values as 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,1,3,4,7,1,1,2,3,5,8,1,3,4,7,1,1,...
%F A226251 Another interesting note: The sequence can also be generated from any two numbers that do not sum to fourteen.

%e A226251 However if the sequence starts with one of the following,
%e A226251 (0,7),(1,4),(2,6),(3,1),(4,2),(4,5),(5,9),(6,8),(7,0),(7,7),(8,6),(9,5) the sequence converges to 1,4,5,9 which is listed as a subsequence of A000285. For all but the trivial exception (0,0) the rest of the two-digit combinations when added together will generate the sequence.

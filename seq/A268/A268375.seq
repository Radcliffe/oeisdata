%N A268375 Numbers k for which A001222(k) = A267116(k).
%C A268375 Numbers k whose prime factorization k = p_1^e_1 * ... * p_m^e_m contains no pair of exponents e_i and e_j (i and j distinct) whose base-2 representations have at least one shared digit-position in which both exponents have a 1-bit.
%C A268375 Equivalently, numbers k such that the factors in the (unique) factorization of k into powers of squarefree numbers with distinct exponents that are powers of two, are prime powers. For example, this factorization of 90 is 10^1 * 3^2, so 90 is not included, as 10 is not prime; whereas this factorization of 320 is 5^1 * 2^2 * 2^4, so 320 is included as 5 and 2 are both prime. - _Peter Munn_, Jan 16 2020
%C A268375 A225546 maps the set of terms 1:1 onto A138302. - _Peter Munn_, Jan 26 2020
%C A268375 Equivalently, numbers k for which A064547(k) = A331591(k). - _Amiram Eldar_, Dec 23 2023

%e A268375 12 = 2^2 * 3^1 is included in the sequence as the exponents 2 ("10" in binary) and 1 ("01" in binary) have no 1-bits in the same position, and 18 = 2^1 * 3^2 is included for the same reason.
%e A268375 On the other hand, 24 = 2^3 * 3^1 is NOT included in the sequence as the exponents 3 ("11" in binary) and 1 ("01" in binary) have 1-bit in the same position 0.
%e A268375 720 = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5^1 is included as the exponents 1, 2 and 4 ("001", "010" and "100" in binary) have no 1-bits in shared positions.
%e A268375 Likewise, 10! = 3628800 = 2^8 * 3^4 * 5^2 * 7^1 is included as the exponents 1, 2, 4 and 8 ("0001", "0010", "0100" and "1000" in binary) have no 1-bits in shared positions. And similarly for any term of A191555.

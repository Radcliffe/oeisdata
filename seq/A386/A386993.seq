%N A386993 Number of 2-dense sublists of divisors of the n-th squarefree number.
%C A386993 In a sublist of divisors of k the terms are in increasing order and two adjacent terms are the same two adjacent terms in the list of divisors of k.
%C A386993 The 2-dense sublists of divisors of k are the maximal sublists whose terms increase by a factor of at most 2.
%F A386993 a(n) = A237271(A005117(n)). (conjectured).
%e A386993 For n = 11 the 11th squarefree number is 15. The list of divisors of 15 is [1, 3, 5, 15]. There are three 2-dense sublists of divisors of 15, they are [1], [3, 5], [15], so a(11) = 3.

%N A159625 Numbers n such that 2^x + 3^y is never prime when max(x,y) = n.
%C A159625 Mark Underwood found that for each nonnegative integer n < 1421 there is at least one prime of the form 2^m + 3^n or 2^n + 3^m with m not exceeding n.
%C A159625 This sequence consists of numbers for which there is no such prime.
%C A159625 David Broadhurst estimated that a fraction in excess of 1/800 of the natural numbers belongs to this sequence and found 17 instances with n < 10^4.
%C A159625 For each of the remaining 9983 nonnegative integers n < 10^4, a prime or probable prime of the form 2^x + 3^y was found with max(x,y) = n.
%C A159625 Each probable prime was subjected to a combination of strong Fermat and strong Lucas tests.

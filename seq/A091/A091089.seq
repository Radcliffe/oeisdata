%N A091089 Numbers which form a prime by appending a 3-digit odd number and form no primes by appending any 1- or 2-digit odd number not beginning with 0.
%C A091089 Many numbers become prime by appending a one-digit odd number. Some numbers (such as 20, 32, 51, etc.) require a 2-digit odd number (A032352 has these). In the first 100000 values of n there are only 22 that require a 3-digit odd number.

%e A091089 a(1)=16557 because 16557 is first number which requires a 3-digit odd number be appended to it to form a prime. 165571, 165573, 165575, ..., 165579, 1655711, 1655713, ..., 1655799 are all nonprime numbers. 16557103 is the first prime formed by appending odd numbers to 16657.
%e A091089 a(2) = 16718 because 16718111 is the first prime formed by appending odd numbers to 16718.
%Y A091089 Cf. A032352 (a(n) requires at least a 2-digit odd number), A068695 (minimum odd number that must be appended to n to form a prime).

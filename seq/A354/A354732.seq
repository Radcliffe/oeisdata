%N A354732 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of distinct positive integers such that in any run of four consecutive terms there is only one pair of terms which share a prime divisor, the rest are all pairwise coprime.
%C A354732 Can be regarded as the reverse of A354717, which has the opposite coprime relations to those defined here. Primes tend to be records but not all records are primes (8, 16 are nonprime records; 11,13 are primes but not records).
%C A354732 Conjecture: Sequence is a permutation of the positive integers in which the primes appear in their natural order.

%e A354732 a(1,2,3,4) = 1,2,3,4 is the lexicographically earliest string of four consecutive terms which satisfy the definition, hence sequence starts with these terms.
%e A354732 a(12,13,14) = 10,17,6 respectively, and 19 is the smallest term not already seen in the sequence such that 10,17,6,19 satisfy the definition ((10,6)=2, and (10,17)=(10,19)=(17,19)=(17,6)=(6,19)=1); therefore a(15)=19.

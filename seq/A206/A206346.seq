%N A206346 Number of solvable clock puzzles with n positions in Final Fantasy XIII-2, up to rotation and reflection.
%C A206346 Equals the number of Hamiltonian directed graphs on n vertices with the properties that: (1) every vertex has outdegree 1 or 2; and (2) the vertices can be arranged in a circle so that the directed edges leaving each vertex are symmetric about that vertex (e.g., if there is a directed edge that points two vertices in the clockwise direction, then the other one must point two vertices in the counterclockwise direction).
%C A206346 The same as A206345, except clock puzzles that are simply rotations or reflections of each other are not counted multiple times.

%N A218252 Start with 1. For each term m, the next term is the smallest positive integer k such that k - (sum of base 2 digits of k) = m. If no such k exists, use the smallest natural number not already in the sequence.
%C A218252 The sequence is a permutation of the positive integers.

%e A218252 To obtain the 2nd term, take the first, 1.  What is the smallest integer k so that k - the number of 1's in k's binary representation is 1? The answer, obviously, is 2. [A213723(1) = 2.]
%e A218252 There is no number that is 2 more than its binary weight [as A213723(2) = 0], therefore we just take 3 as the next term.
%e A218252 Following 3 we can choose either 4 or 5, but 4 is smaller, and is thus the next term of the sequence. [A213723(3) = 4.]

%N A143222 a(0)=0. For n >=1, a(n) = 0 if the binary representation of n occurs at least once in the concatenation of (a(0),a(1),...,a(n-1)). a(n) = 1 otherwise.
%e A143222 The binary representation of 20 is 10100. This occurs in the concatenation of terms a(0) through a(19) like so: 01(10100)1100100111100. So a(20) = 0.

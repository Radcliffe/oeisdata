%N A145361 Characteristic partition array for partitions with parts 1 and 2 only.
%C A145361 Each partition of n, ordered like in Abramowitz-Stegun (A-St order; for the reference see A134278), is mapped to 1 if the partition has parts 1 or 2 only and to 0 otherwise.
%C A145361 First member (K=1) in the family M31hat(-K) of partition number arrays.
%C A145361 The sequence of row lengths is A000041 (partition numbers) [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 22, 30, 42,...].
%C A145361 This array is array A144357 divided entrywise by the array M_3=M3(1)=A036040. Formally 'A144357/A036040'. E.g. a(4,3)= 1 = 3/3 = A144357(4,3)/A036040(4,3).
%C A145361 If M31hat(-1;n,k) is summed over those k numerating partitions with fixed number of parts m one obtains the unsigned triangle S1hat(-1):= A145362 .

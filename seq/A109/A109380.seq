%F A109380 a(n) = LD(n!,(n+1)!).
%e A109380 a(0) = 0 since LD(0!,1!) = LD(1,1) which requires 0 edits.
%e A109380 a(1) = 1 since LD(1!,2!) = LD(1,2) which requires 1 substitution.
%e A109380 a(2) = 1 since LD(2!,3!) = LD(2,6) which requires 1 substitution.
%e A109380 a(3) = 2 since LD(3!,4!) = LD(6,24) which requires 1 substitution and 1 insertion.
%e A109380 a(4) = 2 since LD(4!,5!) = LD(24,120) which requires 1 insertion (1 to the left of 2) and 1 substitution (from 4 to 0).
%e A109380 a(5) = 1 since LD(5!,6!) = LD(120,720) which requires 1 substitution (from 1 to 7).
%e A109380 a(6) = 3 since LD(6!,7!) = LD(720,5040) which requires 1 substitution (from 7 to 5), then 2 insertions (0 to right of 7, 4 to right of 7) and leaving the rightmost digit unedited.
%e A109380 a(7) = 3 as it takes a minimum of 3 edits to get from 5040 to 40320.
%e A109380 a(8) = 5 since LD(8!,9!) = LD(40320,362880) which requires 5 edits.
%e A109380 a(9) = 1 since LD(9!,10!) = LD(362880,3628800) which requires 1 insertion of a zero.
%e A109380 a(10) = 4 since LD(10!,11!) = LD(3628800,39916800) which takes 4 edits.

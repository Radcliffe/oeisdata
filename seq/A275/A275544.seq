%N A275544 Number of distinct terms at a given iteration of the Collatz (or 3x+1) map starting with 0.
%C A275544 If one considers an algebraic approach to the Collatz conjecture, the tree of outcomes of the "Half Or Triple Plus One" process starting with a natural number n:
%C A275544   i
%C A275544   0:                                   n
%C A275544   1:                  3n+1                            n/2
%C A275544   2:        9n+4        (3/2)n+1/2         (3/2)n+1          n/4
%C A275544   3: 27n+13 (9/2)n+2 (9/2)n+5/2 (3/4)n+1/4 (9/2)n+4 (3/4)n+1/2 (3/4)n+1 n/8
%C A275544   ...
%C A275544   reveals that any n that is part of a cycle has to satisfy an equation of the following form:
%C A275544   (3^(i-p)/2^p - 1)n + x_i = 0     i = 0,1,2,3,...  p = 0,...,i
%C A275544   where x_i are the possible constant terms at iteration i, i.e.,
%C A275544   x_0 = [0],
%C A275544   x_1 = [1,0],
%C A275544   x_2 = [4,1/2,1,0],
%C A275544   x_3 = [13,2,5/2,1/4,4,1/2,1,0],
%C A275544   x_4 = [40,13/2,7,1,17/2,5/4,7/4,1/8,13,2,5/2,1/4,4,1/2,1,0],
%C A275544   ...
%C A275544 (Note that not all the combinations of members of x_i and numbers p yield an equation that corresponds to n having to belong to a cycle, instead satisfying at least one equation of the form above is a necessary condition for every n that does).
%C A275544 This sequence is composed of the numbers of distinct possible constant terms at each iteration i.
%C A275544 The only constant term at the zeroth iteration is 0. Since at each iteration both half and triple plus one is considered, the halving of 0 always yields another 0, which always has the same progression tree, and therefore each set x_i contains the members of all previous sets x_j where j < i. This is also the reason why the sequence at the beginning resembles powers of 2 A000079, but later falls behind as more and more duplicates arise.
%C A275544 This sequence is related to A275545, if one sequence is known it is possible to work out the other (see formula).
%C A275544 An empirical observation suggests that the same sequence of numbers arises if we analogously consider the 3n-1 problem (the Collatz conjecture can be referred to as the 3n+1 problem).
%C A275544 The first 9 terms coincide with the Tetranacci numbers A000078.

%N A105206 Number of edges in a pancyclic graph on n+2 vertices with the fewest possible edges.
%C A105206 A graph on n vertices is said to be pancyclic if there are cycles of each length 3, 4, ... n in the graph.

%e A105206 For n = 3 the answer is 3; each of the three vertices is connected to each other vertex, forming a 3-cycle. For n = 4 we find it takes five edges and for n = 5 it takes 6.
%Y A105206 Different from A080036.

%N A328979 Trajectory of 0 under repeated application of the morphism 0 -> 0010, 1 -> 1010.
%C A328979 The morphism in the definition, 0 -> 0010, 1 -> 1010, is the square of the morphism tau: 0 -> 10, 1 -> 00.
%C A328979 This sequence is also the 0-limiting word of tau (see A284948).
%C A328979 It is also the image of A080426 under the morphism 1 -> 0,0,1,0; 3 -> 0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0.
%C A328979 This sequence underlies all of A297469, A298468, A328190, and A328196.
%C A328979 Theorem: a(n) = 1 iff the binary expansion of n-1 ends in an odd number of 0's (cf. A036554, A072939). For proof see comments by _Michel Dekking_ in A284948.
%C A328979 Is this A096268 with an additional 0 added in front? - _R. J. Mathar_, Nov 13 2019 [Yes: it follows, e.g., from the above theorem. - _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, Jan 12 2020]

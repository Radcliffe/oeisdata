%N A070296 Let sphi(k) = number of primes less than k and coprime to it (A048865); then a(n) = number of integers m with sphi(m) = n.
%F A070296 a(n) = number of m such that A048865(m) = n.
%e A070296 a(4) = 3. The three values of m for which sphi(m) = 4 are 11, 14 and 15. The coprime primes less than 11 are 2, 3, 5 and 7. The coprime primes less than 14 are 3, 5, 11 and 13. The coprime primes less than 15 are 2, 7, 11 and 13.

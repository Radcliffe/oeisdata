%N A356022 Decimal expansion of the infinite series Sum_{j>=0} 1/2^^j where ^^ indicates tetration.
%C A356022 This constant converges very fast to a finite value around 118785/65536, since tetration (AKA hyper-4) makes 2^^k become very big so quickly, even for "relatively small" values of k (e.g., 1/2^^5 < 1/10^19728.30).
%C A356022 This sequence has been inspired by a question posted by the user Max Muller on MathOverflow on July 2022 (see Links).

%N A328383 a(n) gives the number of iterations of x -> A003415(x) needed to reach the first number which is either a divisor or multiple of n, but not both at the same time. If no such number can ever be reached, a(n) is 0 (when either n is of the form p^p, or if the iteration would never stop). When the number reached is a divisor of n, a(n) is -1 * iteration count.
%C A328383 The absolute value of a(n) tells how many columns right from the leftmost column in array A258651 one needs to go at row n, before one (again) finds either a divisor or a multiple of n, with 0's reserved for cases like 4 and 27 where the same value continues forever. If one finds a divisor before a multiple, then the value of a(n) will be negative, otherwise it will be positive.
%C A328383 Question: What is the value of a(91) ?

%F A328383 a(A000040(n)) = -1.
%F A328383 a(A051674(n)) = 0.
%e A328383 For n = 6, its arithmetic derivative A003415(6) = 5 is neither its divisor nor its multiple, but the second arithmetic derivative A003415(5) = 1 is its divisor, thus a(6) = -2.
%e A328383 For n = 8, its arithmetic derivative A003415(8) = 12 is neither its divisor nor its multiple, but the second arithmetic derivative A003415(12) = 16 is its multiple, thus a(8) = +2.
%e A328383 Numbers reached for n=2..28 (with positions of the form p^p are filled with the same p^p): 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 16, 1, 1, 1, 8592, 1, 1, 410267320320, 32, 1, 1, 1, 240, 7, 1, 1, 48, 1, 410267320320, 27, 9541095424. For example, we have a(12) = 9 and the 9th arithmetic derivative of 12 is A003415^(9)(12) = 8592 = 716*12.

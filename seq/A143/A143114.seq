%N A143114 a(n) = the smallest positive integer that is coprime to n and has the same number of (nonleading) 0's in its binary representation as n has in binary.

%e A143114 For n = 20: 20 in binary is 10100, which has three 0's. The positive integers that each have three 0's in their binary representations are 8,17,18,20, etc. The smallest of these that is coprime to 20 is 17. So a(20) = 17.

%C A145355 This sequence suggests that the distance between a factorial and the closest power is tightly bounded.
%C A145355 Generated by _Ed Pegg Jr_ in response to three Alexander R. Povolotsky conjectures:
%C A145355 1) n! + n^2 != m^2 (except for trivial case with n=0, m=1) per conducted calculations doesn't yield any solutions from n=1 to n=2*10^5.
%C A145355 2) n! + Sum_{j=1..n} j^2 != m^2 per conducted calculations doesn't yield any solutions from n=1 to n=2*10^6.
%C A145355 3) n! + prime(n) != m^k is too difficult to cover by exhaustive calculations ...

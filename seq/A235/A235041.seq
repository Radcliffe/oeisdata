%N A235041 Factorization-preserving bijection from nonnegative integers to GF(2)[X]-polynomials, version which fixes the elements that are irreducible in both semirings.
%C A235041 Like A091202 this is a factorization-preserving isomorphism from integers to GF(2)[X]-polynomials. The latter are encoded in the binary representation of n like this: n=11, '1011' in binary, stands for polynomial x^3+x+1, n=25, '11001' in binary, stands for polynomial x^4+x^3+1. However, this version does not map the primes (A000040) straight to the irreducible GF(2)[X] polynomials (A014580), but instead fixes the intersection of those two sets (A091206), and maps the elements in their set-wise difference A000040 \ A014580 (= A091209) in numerical order to the set-wise difference A014580 \ A000040 (= A091214).
%C A235041 The composite values are defined by the multiplicativity. E.g., we have a(3n) = A048724(a(n)) and a(3^n) = A001317(n) for all n.
%C A235041 This map satisfies many of the same identities as A091202, e.g., we have A000005(n) = A091220(a(n)), A001221(n) = A091221(a(n)), A001222(n) = A091222(a(n)) and A008683(n) = A091219(a(n)) for all n >= 1.

%F A235041 a(0)=0, a(1)=1, a(p) = p for those primes p whose binary representations encode also irreducible GF(2)[X]-polynomials (i.e., p is in A091206), and for the rest of the primes q (those whose binary representation encode composite GF(2)[X]-polynomials, i.e., q is in A091209), a(q) = A091214(A235043(q)), and for composite natural numbers, a(p * q * r * ...) = a(p) X a(q) X a(r) X ..., where p, q, r, ... are primes and X stands for the carryless multiplication (A048720) of GF(2)[X] polynomials encoded as explained in the Comments section.
%e A235041 Here (t X u) = A048720(t,u):
%e A235041 a(2)=2, a(3)=3 and a(7)=7, as 2, 3 and 7 are all in A091206.
%e A235041 a(4) = a(2*2) = a(2) X a(2) = 2 X 2 = 4.
%e A235041 a(9) = a(3*3) = a(3) X a(3) = 3 X 3 = 5.
%e A235041 a(5) = 25, as 5 is the first term of A091209 and 25 is the first term of A091214.
%e A235041 a(10) = a(2*5) = a(2) X a(5) = 2 X 25 = 50.
%e A235041 Similarly, a(17) = 55, as 17 is the second term of A091209 and 55 is the second term of A091214.
%e A235041 a(21) = a(3*7) = a(3) X a(7) = 3 X 7 = 9.

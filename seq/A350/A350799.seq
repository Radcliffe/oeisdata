%N A350799 The number of decimal places of Pi that are computed correctly when using Machin's formula with n terms of the Taylor series.
%C A350799 Machin's formula states that Pi/4 = 4*arctan(1/5) - arctan(1/239). An approximation of Pi can be found by computing this using a Taylor series approximation of arctan. a(n) is the number of decimal places that are correct when n terms are included in the Taylor series approximation.

%e A350799 For n = 3, Machin's formula with three terms in the Taylor series gives 3.14162102932503442504 as an approximation of Pi. The first 3 decimal places (141) are correct, so a(3) = 3.

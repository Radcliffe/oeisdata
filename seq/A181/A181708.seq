%N A181708 Numbers of faces of polyhedra made entirely of regular polygons that are not prisms or antiprisms.
%C A181708 The prisms and antiprisms form infinite sequences of polyhedra that contain all integers >= 5 and all even numbers >= 8 respectively.
%e A181708 19 is not in this sequence because the heptadecagonal prism is the only 19-faced polyhedron made entirely of regular polygons. 36 is not in this sequence because the 34-gonal prism and heptadecagonal antiprism are the only 36-faced polyhedra made entirely of regular polygons.

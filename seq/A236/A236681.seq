%N A236681 Positive integers a such that there exist integers b, c > 0 with 1/a + 1/b + 1/c = 1/2.
%C A236681 According to J. Baez, the reason why 42 is the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything, cf. LINK.
%C A236681 A subsequence of A236686, which has an initial 2 as the only additional term.
%C A236681 Also the number of sides that any one of a set of three regular polygons must have if they join at one vertex. The total internal angle of the three regular k_i sided polygons must be one revolution: Sum_{i=1..3} (1/2 - 1/k_i) = 1. This can be rearranged to the above form 1/k_1 + 1/k_2 + 1/k_3 = 1/2. Incidentally, also the number of sides that any one of an arbitrary set of regular polygons must have if they join at one vertex. - _Philip Gei√üler_, Mar 07 2025

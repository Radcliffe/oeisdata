%N A367173 a(n) = the maximum number of distinct tilings of a polyomino of size n using any combination of polyomino tiles of sizes 1 through n.
%C A367173 The sequence considers reflections and rotations as distinct tilings.
%C A367173 The polyominoes being tiled and the tiles themselves may be with or without holes.
%C A367173 The number of tilings of a 2-by-n rectangle is 2*A005668(n). Along with the fact that a(n+1) >= 2*a(n), because any added cell can either remain a monomino, or be joined to a neighboring polyomino, this yields a(1) through a(8). Other shapes take over beginning at a(9). - _Charlie Neder_, Sep 10 2025
%e A367173 a(3) = 4 because any tromino can be tiled by (1) a tromino, (2) 3 monominoes, and (3) a monomino and a domino in two distinct ways.

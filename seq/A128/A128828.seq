%N A128828 The number of regular hexagons found by constructing n equally-spaced points on each side of the hexagon and drawing lines parallel to the hexagon side.
%C A128828 Use 1 midpoint (resp. 2 points) on each side placed to divide each side into 2 (resp. 3) equally-sized segments (or so on), do the same construction for every side of the hexagon so that each side is equally divided in the same way. Connect all such points to each other with lines that are parallel to at least 1 side of the hexagon.
%C A128828 Similar constructions to sequences A002717 (dividing a triangle), A000330 (dividing a square) and other sequences pending for similar constructions in other polygons.

%F A128828 a(n) = (11*n^4 + 78*n^3 + 1413*n^2 - 2322*n + 324)/324 when n = 3k,
%F A128828   (-13*n^4 + 670*n^3 - 3219*n^2 + 9934*n - 6724)/324 when n = 1 + 3k,
%F A128828   (5*n^4-46*n^3 + 1515*n^2 - 6046*n + 7940)/108 when n = 2 + 3k (conjecture).
%e A128828 With 1 point (a midpoint on each side), 2 regular hexagons are found. With 3 points on each side, 15 regular hexagons are found in total and so on.

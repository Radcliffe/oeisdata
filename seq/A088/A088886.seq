%N A088886 Minimum number of consecutive previous nonnegative integers to n that must be concatenated together in ascending order such that n divides the concatenated term, or zero if n divides no such concatenation.
%C A088886 Concatenation always end at n-1 and cannot start further than n-n (zero). Hence the maximum value of a(n) is n.
%e A088886 a(7) = 2 because 7 will divide the number formed by concatenating the 2 integers prior to 7 in ascending order (i.e. 56). a(6) = 0 because 6 will not divide 5, 45, 345, 2345, 12345, or 012345.
%Y A088886 Cf. A088797, A088799, A088868, A088870, A088872, A088885.

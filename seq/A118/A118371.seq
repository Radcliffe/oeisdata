%N A118371 Fastest growing sequence of primes satisfying Goldbach's conjecture.
%C A118371 Although there are 78498 primes < 10^6, only 3030 primes are required to form all even numbers < 10^6. There are 10582, 36308 and 123139 of these primes less than 10^7, 10^8 and 10^9, respectively. The asymptotic density of these primes appears to be 0. The number of these primes < x is roughly 0.85 sqrt(x log(x)).
%C A118371 Assuming the strong form of Goldbach's conjecture, Granville proves that thin sets of primes exist such that every even number >2 is the sum of two members of the set. - _T. D. Noe_, Apr 26 2006

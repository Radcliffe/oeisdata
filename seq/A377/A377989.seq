%N A377989 Numbers k such that A003415(A276085(k)) has no p^p-factors, where A003415 is the arithmetic derivative, and A276085 is fully additive with a(p) = p#/p.
%C A377989 Numbers k such that A373842(k) is in A048103.
%C A377989 Odd primes (A065091) are all present. See comment in A024451.
%e A377989 A276085(1) = 0 and A276085(2) = 1, and as A003415(0) = A003415(1) = 0, and because 0 is a multiple of every number of the form p^p, with p prime, 1 and 2 are NOT included in this sequence.
%e A377989 A276085(3) = 2, A003415(2) = 1, and as 1 has no p^p-factors, 3 is included in this sequence.
%e A377989 A276085(34) = 30031 = A002110(1-1)+A002110(7-1) (34 = 2*17 = prime(1)*prime(7)), and because A003415(30031) = 568 = 2^2 * 2 * 71, with a factor of the form p^p, 34 is NOT included in this sequence.

%N A079814 Odd integers k such that phi(k)/k < 6/Pi^2 where phi = A000010.
%C A079814 Since, as Euler proved, the random chance of two integers not having a common prime factor is 6/Pi^2, these are the odd integers that share common factors with an above average fraction of integers. Is it known, or can it be calculated, what portion of odd integers satisfy this condition? (All even numbers qualify; for all multiples of 2, phi(n)/n <= 0.5.)
%C A079814 The sequence is closed under multiplication by any odd number. If we include the even numbers, the sequence of primitive terms begins 2, 15, 21, 33, 663, ... . - _Peter Munn_, Apr 11 2021

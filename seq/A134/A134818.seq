%N A134818 Number of unlabeled connected loopless multigraphs with n nodes of degree 4 or less and with at most triple edges.
%C A134818 From _Natan Arie Consigli_, May 29 2017: (Start)
%C A134818 Original name was "Number of hydrocarbon structures that can be drawn (excluding stereoisomers)" but this has been replaced with a mathematical definition which is more consistent with the terms of the sequence and the program.
%C A134818 In chemical terms this counts the following, given n carbon atoms:
%C A134818 - carbon allotropes;
%C A134818 - aliphatic hydrocarbons;
%C A134818 - resonance structures of graphically non-equivalent anti-aromatic and aromatic hydrocarbons.
%C A134818 Some molecules are theoretical and may or may not exist.
%C A134818 (End)
%C A134818 Computed over a period of several years and confirmed using the Molgen program.
%C A134818 Terms for n = 8,9,10 calculated using an exhaustive algorithm and Nauty. The algorithm correctly found the 7 known terms and the known acyclic hydrocarbons (up to n=10, see A002986) were extracted from the results correctly. - Vesa Linja-aho (vesa.linja-aho(AT)tkk.fi), Apr 17 2008
%C A134818 Except for a(2), the same as A289157. The extra graph in A289157 is the 4-regular graph on 2 nodes. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Mar 20 2020

%F A134818 a(n) = A289157(n) for n > 2. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Mar 20 2020
%e A134818 For n = 2 there are a(2) = 3 structures that can be drawn with 2 carbons (ethane, ethene, and ethyne).
%e A134818 For n = 7 there are a(7) = 4449 structures that can be drawn with 7 carbons.

%Y A134818 Cf. A134819 gives the number of possible structures, broken down by units of unsaturation.

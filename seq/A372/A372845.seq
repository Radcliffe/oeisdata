%N A372845 a(n) is the number of parking functions of order n for which the fifth spot is lucky.
%C A372845 This sequence enumerates parking functions with lucky fifth spot (where a lucky spot is one which is parked in by a car which prefers that spot).
%H A372845 Steve Butler, Kimberly Hadaway, Victoria Lenius, Preston Martens, and Marshall Moats, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07873">Lucky cars and lucky spots in parking functions</a>, arXiv:2412.07873 [math.CO], 2024. See p. 10.
%F A372845 a(n) = (3/5)*(n+1)^(n-1) - (1/30)*(118*n^3 - 531*n^2 + 659*n - 192)*(n-4)^(n-4).
%e A372845 For clarity, we write parentheses around parking functions. For n = 6, there are a(6) = 8733 solutions. An example of a parking function of order 6 with a lucky fifth spot is (1,4,1,5,2,2); here, the fourth car parks in the fifth spot which is its preferred spot. This parking function contributes to our count. A non-example is the parking function (1,1,1,1,1,5); here, the fifth car parks in the fifth spot, but its preference is spot 1. This parking function does not contribute to our count.

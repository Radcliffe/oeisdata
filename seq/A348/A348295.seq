%N A348295 a(n) = Sum_{k=1..n} (-1)^(floor(k*(sqrt(2)-1))).
%C A348295 Problem B6 of the 81st William Powell Putnam Mathematical Competition (2020) asks to show that a(n) >= 0 for all n.
%C A348295 Conjecture: (1) Sequence is unbounded from above. Moreover, it seems that the earliest occurrence of m is A000129(m) for even m and A001333(m) for odd m (this has been confirmed for m <= 32 by _Chai Wah Wu_, Oct 21 2021). See A084068 for the conjectured indices of records.
%C A348295 (2) There are infinitely many 0's in the sequence. See A348299 for indices of 0. Since |a(n+1) - a(n)| = 1, (1)(2) together imply that this sequence hits every natural number infinitely many times.

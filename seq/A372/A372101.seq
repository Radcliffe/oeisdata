%N A372101 Number of steps required to kill a hydra composed of a linear graph with n edges where, after removing the rightmost head at step s, s new heads grow to the right of the head's grandparent node (see comments).
%C A372101 To kill the hydra means to remove all of its heads, leaving only the root node.
%C A372101 New heads are created "to the right" of any existing head, i.e., they are now rightmost when considering which head to remove next.
%C A372101 The effect of this rule is that the next head to be removed is always any one of the heads closest to the root.
%C A372101 Please note that the a(4) value reported on the Numberphile link (983038) is wrong.
%C A372101 See the first Li link for the derivation of a(5), and which is hugely too big to display.
%C A372101 The problem can be phrased as follows. Start with a state S consisting of (v, s), where the vector v encodes the hydra and s is the next step number (if there is a next step). Initially, v starts with n ones and s = 1. At each iteration, do the following.
%C A372101 1. If v[1] = 1 and all other v[i] = 0 then the hydra is dead and a(n) = s-1.
%C A372101 2. Otherwise, find the least index i where v[i] >= 2, or if no such i then the greatest i where v[i] = 1.
%C A372101 3. Decrement v[i].
%C A372101 4. If i > 1 then increase v[i-1] by s.
%C A372101 5. Increase s by 1 and return to step 1.
%C A372101 See the first Corneth link for a step-by-step implementation of this procedure for a(3) and a(4).
%C A372101 A372421 is a variation where new heads grow to the left of all existing heads, while in A372478 subtrees grow instead of just heads.

%F A372101 a(3) = (2 + 1)*2^2 - 1 = (2*a(1) + 1)*(2^(a(1) + 1)) - 1 = 11.
%F A372101 a(4) = (2^2^2 + 1)*2^2^2^2 - 1 = (2^^a(2) + 1)*(2^^(a(2) + 1)) - 1 = 1114111, where ^^ is Knuth's double arrow notation (tetration).
%F A372101 For n >= 2, a(n) = F_1(F_2(...F_{n-1}(1))), where F_i(x) = (F_{i-1})^x (x+1) = F_{i-1}(F_{i-1}(...x times...(x+1))) and F_1(x) = 2*x + 1. See second Li link.

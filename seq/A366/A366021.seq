%N A366021 a(1) = 1; a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest positive number that has not yet appeared that shares a factor with a(n-1) and, if a(n) < n, with a(n - a(n)).
%C A366021 The majority of terms lie near the line a(n) = 1.1*n. The only exceptions are the prime valued terms whose appearance in the sequence is delayed relative to their magnitude, e.g. a(1835) = 61. Other than the first two terms there are no other fixed points in the first 100000 terms, and it is likely no more exist. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.

%e A366021 a(5) = 8 as 8 shares a factor with a(4) = 6 and, as 8 > 5, it is not required to share a factor with any previous term. Note that 3 also shares a factor with 6, but as 3 < 5 it is required to share a factor with a(5-3) = a(2) = 2 which is does not, so a(5) cannot be 3. This is the first term to differ from A064413.
%e A366021 a(10) = 3 as 3 shares a factor with a(9) = 15 and, as 3 < 10, it is required to share a factor with a(10-3) = a(7) = 12, which it does.

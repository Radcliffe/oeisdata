%N A191749 Numbers not the sum of a smaller number and its prime factors (with multiplicity).
%C A191749 If a number is not squarefree, then its repeated prime factors are added as many times as the exponent indicates (e.g., the sum of prime factors of 8 is 6 since 8 = 2 * 2 * 2 and 2 + 2 + 2 = 6).
%C A191749 No even semiprime (A100484) can be in this sequence, since, if nothing else, it is the sum of a prime number and that prime number's only prime factor (itself).

%e A191749 3 is in the sequence since neither 1 + sopfr(1) nor 2 + sopfr(2) add up to 3 (instead these equal 2 and 4 respectively).
%e A191749 Because 2 + sopfr(2) = 4, the number 4 is not in this sequence.

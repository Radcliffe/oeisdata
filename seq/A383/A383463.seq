%N A383463 Maximum number of regions determined by n copies of a long-tailed letter Wu. [Duplicate of A140064, will be merged into that entry]
%C A383463 The letter Wu, ·óê, is like a V but with three arms instead of two. Wu is included in the Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics section of Unicode. The Unicode symbol for Wu is 0x2a5b. Wu is also called a "Boolean OR with middle stem", and is also the alchemical symbol Dissolve-2.
%C A383463 The long-tailed Wu is a pencil of three semi-infinite lines originating from a point. The angles between the three lines are arbitrary.
%C A383463 For the analogous sequences for long-tailed letters V and Z see A130883 and A117625.
%C A383463 One expects this to be a quadratic in n. The first 4 terms match A140064 (which has a different offset), so if a(4) = 63 and a(5) = 101, it is a reasonable conjecture that this IS essentially the same as A140064. If so it will be merged with that entry and recycled. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jun 19 2025

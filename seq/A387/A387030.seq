%N A387030 Irregular triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of primes in the k-th 2-dense sublist of divisors of n, with n >= 1, k >= 1.
%C A387030 In a sublist of divisors of n the terms are in increasing order and two adjacent terms are the same two adjacent terms in the list of divisors of n.
%C A387030 The 2-dense sublists of divisors of n are the maximal sublists whose terms increase by a factor of at most 2.
%C A387030 It is conjectured that row lengths are given by A237271.

%e A387030 For n = 10 the list of divisors of 10 is [1, 2, 5, 10]. There are two 2-dense sublists of divisors of 10, they are [1, 2] and [5, 10]. There is a prime number in each sublist, so row 10 is [1, 1].
%e A387030 For n = 15 the list of divisors of 15 is [1, 3, 5, 15]. There are three 2-dense sublists of divisors of 15, they are [1], [3, 5], [15]. Only the second sublist contains primes, so row 15 is [0, 2, 0].
%Y A387030 Row sums give A001221.

%N A172424 Numbers k > 9 with digits different from 0 and 1 such that both the sum of digits and the product of digits divide k.
%C A172424 From _David A. Corneth_, Aug 14 2025: (Start):
%C A172424 When searching terms it is convenient to look for terms t via their smallest number having the same digits (with same multiplicities) as t.
%C A172424 For example the term 432 can be found by permution digits of 234.
%C A172424 It enables to skip a lot of candidates via the following properties:
%C A172424 - If the product of digits of m is a multiple of 3 but the sum of digits of m is not a multiple of 3 then m is not a term.
%C A172424 - If the product of digits of m is a multiple of 9 but the sum of digits of m is not a multiple of 9 then m is not a term.
%C A172424 - The product of digits of a term m cannot be a multiple of 10.
%C A172424 - If the sum of digits of number m is a multiple of 2 but the product of digits of m is not then m cannot be a term.
%C A172424 - If the sum of digits of number m is a multiple of 5 but the product of digits of m is not then m cannot be a term.
%C A172424 It then also helps to reduce the number of permutations to check by looking for possible last digits.
%C A172424 For example when looking for terms with the same digits as 2333466778 we could find there are 151200 permutations. However we must have that such number is divisible by the product of digits i.e. by 3048192 and also by the sum of digits i.e. by 49.
%C A172424 The lcm of 3048192 and 49 is 3048192 so such term must be divisible by 3048192. That number has 8 factors 2.
%C A172424 It turns out there are only 319 possibilities for last 8 digits such that that number is divisible by 2^8 = 256.
%C A172424 One such possibility is ending in 36786432 and so {3, 7} come before that in some permutation.
%C A172424 That leaves at most 2*319 numbers to check instead of 151200. (End)

%N A257739 Numbers n for which A256999(n) > n; numbers that can be made larger by rotating (by one or more steps) the non-msb bits of their binary representation (with A080541 or A080542).
%C A257739 Note that A256999(a(n)) is always in A257250.
%C A257739 If we define a co-necklace to be a finite sequence that is lexicographically maximal (not minimal) among all of its cyclic rotations, these are numbers whose binary expansion, without the most significant digit, is not a co-necklace. Numbers whose binary expansion, without the most significant digit, is not a necklace are A329367. - _Gus Wiseman_, Nov 14 2019

%e A257739 For n = 5 with binary representation "101" if we rotate other bits than the most significant bit (that is, only the two rightmost digits "01") one step to either direction we get "110" = 6 > 5, so 5 can be made larger by such rotations and thus 5 is included in this sequence.
%e A257739 For n = 6 with binary representation "110" no such rotation will yield a larger number and thus 6 is NOT included in this sequence.
%e A257739 For n = 10 with binary representation "1010" if we rotate other bits than the most significant bit (that is, only the three rightmost digits "010") either one step to the left or two steps to the right we get "1100" = 12 > 10, thus 10 is included in this sequence.

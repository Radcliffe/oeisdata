%N A278837 Primes p such that the ring of algebraic integers of Q(sqrt(p)) does not have unique factorization.
%C A278837 It is still unknown whether there are infinitely many real, positive, squarefree d such that O_(Q(sqrt(d))) has unique factorization (or, to put it another way, the class number is 1).
%C A278837 If one only looks at small prime numbers, one could easily be tempted to think that if p is prime then O_(Q(sqrt(p))) has unique factorization.
%C A278837 By contrast, given distinct primes p and q, one could think that O_(Q(sqrt(p*q))) generally does not have unique factorization, especially if p = 5.
%C A278837 It then often happens that both p and q are irreducible, and therefore p*q = (sqrt(p*q))^2 represents two distinct factorizations of the same number.
%C A278837 Such an obvious example of multiple distinct factorizations is obviously not available in O_(Q(sqrt(p))).

%e A278837 In Z[sqrt(79)], to pick just one example of a number having more than one distinct factorization, we verify that 3 and 5 are both irreducible, yet 15 = 3 * 5 = (-1)*(8 - sqrt(79))*(8 + sqrt(79)). Thus 79 is in the sequence.
%e A278837 Z[sqrt(83)] is a unique factorization domain, hence 83 is not in the sequence.

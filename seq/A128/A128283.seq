%N A128283 Numbers of the form m = p1 * p2 where for each d|m we have (d+m/d)/2 prime and p1 < p2 both prime.
%C A128283 The symmetric representation of sigma (A237593) for p1*p2, SRS(p1*p2), consists of either 4 or 3 regions. Let p1 < p2. Then 2*p1 < p2 implies that SRS(p1*p2), consists of 2 pairs of regions of widths 1 having respective sizes (p1*p2 + 1)/2 and (p1 + p2)/2; and p2 < 2*p1 implies that SRS(p1*p2) consists of 2 outer regions of width 1 and size (p1*p2 + 1)/2 and a central region of maximum width 2 of size p1 + p2 . Therefore, if SRS(p1*p2) has four regions, the area of each is a prime number (see A233562) and if it has three regions, the central area is an even semiprime (A100484). - _Hartmut F. W.

%e A128283 9=3*3 is not in the sequence even though (1+9)/2 and (3+3)/2 are primes, see also A340482.
%e A128283 a(33) = 1537 = 29*53 is the first number for which the symmetric representation of sigma consists of three regions ( 769, 82, 769 ) with 5 units of width 2 straddling the diagonal in the central region; (1537+1)/2 = 769 and (29+53)/2 = 41 are primes. (End)

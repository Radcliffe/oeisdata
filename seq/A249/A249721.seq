%N A249721 Numbers whose base-3 representation consists entirely of 0's and 2's, except possibly for a single pair of adjacent 1's among them.
%C A249721 9 divides neither C(s-1,s/2) (= A001700(s/2)) nor C(s,s/2) (= A000984(s/2)) if and only if s = a(n).

%e A249721    2, which in base 3 is also '2', satisfies the condition, thus it is included;
%e A249721    4, which in base 3 is  '11', is included;
%e A249721    6, which in base 3 is  '20', is included;
%e A249721    8, which in base 3 is  '22', is included;
%e A249721   12, which in base 3 is '110', is included;
%e A249721   14, which in base 3 is '112', is included;
%e A249721 however, e.g., 13, 40, and 130, whose ternary representations are '111', '1111' and '11211' respectively, are not included, because they all contain more than one pair of 1's.

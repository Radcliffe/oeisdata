%N A384629 Maximum number of steps that an n-instruction Turing machine (allowing any number of states and symbols) can take on an initially blank tape before eventually halting.
%C A384629 This sequence is uncomputable.
%C A384629 No halt state is required. The machine halts whenever the current state/tape symbol combination does not have a corresponding instruction. For example, if the machine is in state B at a tape symbol 1, but there is no instruction for B1, the machine halts. As a specific example, the 2-instruction machine defined by A0:0RB, B0:1LA halts after 3 steps when the machine enters state B at a tape symbol 1. A halt state can be effectively simulated by transitioning to a state not included in the machine's instructions. As another example, the 2-state 2-symbol busy beaver can be given as A0:1RB, A1:1LB, B0:1LA, B1:1RC, where "C" effectively substitutes for "H". So the machine becomes a 3-state 2-symbol machine, but with no instructions for the third state "C".
%C A384629 This sequence effectively combines the various Busy Beaver step functions S(states,symbols) into a single sequence defined only by number of allowable instructions Si(inst). It is very interesting to observe the number of states and symbols associated with the champion machine for each number of instructions.

%e A384629 a(0)=0.  No instructions means machine instantly halts. (Philosophical question: Can something that was never moving actually "halt"?)
%e A384629 a(1)=1.  A0:0RB (One of two 1-instruction machines taking 1 step.)
%e A384629 a(2)=3.  A0:0RB, B0:1LA
%e A384629 a(3)=5.  A0:0RB, B0:1LA, B1:1RB (One of 14 3-instruction machines taking 5 steps.)
%e A384629 a(4)=16. A0:1RB, B0:0RC, C0:1LC, C1:0LA
%e A384629 a(5)=37. A0:1RB, A1:2LB, B0:2LA, B1:2RB, B2:1LB (BB(2,3) minus the halt state for A2)
%e A384629 a(6)=123? A0:1RB, A1:3LA, A2:1RA, A3:0LA, B0:2LA, B3:3RA (No 6-instruction machines halt between 123 and 50000 steps, but this does not prove that a(6)=123.)
%e A384629 a(7)>=3932963. Must be at least S(2,4)-1, which has 7 non-halting instructions.
%e A384629 a(8)>=119112334170342539.  Must be at least candidate S(3,3)-1, which has 8 non-halting instructions. a(8) will not easily be proven because a different 3-state 3-symbol machine "Bigfoot", having 8 non-halting instructions, must first be proven never to halt, requiring solving a Collatz-like problem.

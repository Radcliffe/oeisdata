%e A384793 a(25) = 2 because the 25 primes 2, 3, ..., 97 don't have a zero in their decimal representation, terminated by 101.
%e A384793 a(1) = 461717 because it is the smallest zeroless prime, whose nearest lower and upper prime neighbors 461707 and 461801 both have at least one zero in their decimal representation.

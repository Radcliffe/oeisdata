%N A277053 Decimal expansion of real zero x between 78 and 79 of the derivative of the function plotting the invariant points for the exponential function of the form x^y = y.
%C A277053 It has not yet been determined if this number has a closed form.
%F A277053 The derivative x^y = y, or y = -ProductLog(-log(x))/log(x) when solved for y, is the function in which this value is a root. The derivative is (ProductLog(-log(x)))^2/(x*(log(x))^2*(1+ProductLog(-log(x)))).

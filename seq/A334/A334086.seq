%N A334086 Positive numbers not of the form 2*x^4 + y*(y+1)/2 + z*(z+1)/2 with x,y,z nonnegative integers.
%C A334086 Conjecture: The sequence has totally 216 terms as listed in the b-file.
%C A334086 As none of the 216 terms in the b-file is divisible by 3, the conjecture implies that for each nonnegative integer n we can write 3*n as 2*x^4 + y*(y+1)/2 + z*(z+1)/2 and hence 12*n+1 = 8*x^4 + (y+z+1)^2 + (y-z)^2, where x,y,z are integers.
%C A334086 Our computation indicates that after the 216-th term 4592329 there are no other terms below 10^8.
%C A334086 It is known that each n = 0,1,2,... can be written as the sum of two triangular numbers and twice a square.
%C A334086 a(217) > 10^9, if it exists. - _Giovanni Resta_, Apr 14 2020

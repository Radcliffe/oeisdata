%N A319463 Least constant t > 0 such that the simple continued fraction of t may be expressed by partial denominators A319464(n) as well as fractional partial denominators (2*A319464(n) + 3)/3.
%C A319463 This constant t is the least positive real number satisfying the definition.
%C A319463 Largest constant with the same property equals 3 + 1/t = 3.3474953831...
%C A319463 Note that (sqrt(13) + 3)/2 = [3; 3, 3, 3, ...] also satisfies the property.
%C A319463 Is this constant transcendental?

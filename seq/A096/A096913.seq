%N A096913 Numbers k such that (largest digit of k)^(smallest digit of k) + k is a square.
%C A096913 Conjecture: 0 and 3844 are the only squares in this sequence.
%C A096913 There are only finitely many squares in the sequence because for some square big enough the offset to the next square is greater than 9^9. Now, for each number d = (largest digit of k)^(smallest digit of k) we just have to walk through the squares, check if this square has the correct (largest digit of k)^(smallest digit of k) property and added d is also a square. I have done that search computation exhaustively (using a PARI program). There are no more squares. - _Maon Wenders_, Jun 02 2012
%C A096913 This sequence has infinitely many terms because there are infinitely many numbers b^2 - 1 that contain a zero in their decimal expansion. - _T. D. Noe_, Jul 20 2012

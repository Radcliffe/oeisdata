%N A369860 The orbit of n under iterations of x -> c(x)*10^L(x-c(x)) + x-c(x), where c(x) = floor(x^(1/3))^3, L(x) = floor(log_10(max(x,1))+1), enters a pseudo-loop x(k) = a^3 * 10^((k-k0)*L(b)) + b beyond some k0. This sequence lists the a-values.
%C A369860 The iterated function can also be defined as x -> concatenate(c(x), x-c(x)), where c = A048762 gives the largest perfect cube <= x and x - c(x) = A055400(x) is the "cube excess" of x. L = A055642 gives the number of decimal digits.
%C A369860 The corresponding b-values are listed in A369861.

%e A369860 Starting with 1, we get 1 -> 10 -> 82 (since 8 is the largest cube <= 10, at distance 2) -> 6418 (since the cube 64 is at distance 18) -> 5832586 (since 5832 = 18^3 is at distance 586) -> 5832000586 (since 180^3 is again at distance 586) -> ...: Each time 3 '0's will be inserted in front of the remainder which remains always the same, as does the cube root a(1) = 18, up to factors of 10.
%e A369860 Starting with 2, we get 2 -> 11 (since the largest cube <= 2 is 1, at distance 1) -> 83 (since largest cube <= 11 is 8, at distance 2) -> 6419 (since the cube 64 is at distance 19) -> 5832587 (since 5832 = 18^3 is at distance 587). We see that in this sequence each term is just one more than that of the preceding sequence, so the cube root remains the same, a(2) = a(1) = 18.
%e A369860 For n = 18, we get 18 -> 810 (since the largest cube <= 18 is 8, at distance 10) -> 72981 (since the cube 729 is at distance 81) -> 689214060 (since 68921 = 41^3 is at distance 4060) -> 688465387748673 (since 688465387 = 883^3 is at distance 748673), from where on the cube root a(18) = 883 gets an additional factor 10 at each step, but the cube excess A055400 remains the same, A369861(18) = 748673.

%N A124183 a(0) = 0; a(1) = 1; for n >= 2, a(n) = the n-th integer from among those positive integers which are coprime to a(n-1)+a(n-2).
%C A124183 For n>=9, a(n-1)+a(n-2) is even so a(n) is odd and >= 2n-1. It appears that a(n)=2n-1 infinitely often, when a(n-1)+a(n-2)=2p with p prime. A good upper bound is not known; presumably a(n)/n is unbounded, since it's large whenever a(n-1)+a(n-2) is divisible by many small primes. - _Dean Hickerson_, Dec 07 2006
%C A124183 Zak Seidov observed that straight lines are visible in the graph of a(n). The lowest line is given by the points with a(n)=2n-1. There are also many points a short distance above this line; these occur when a(n-1)+a(n-2) is a small power of 2 times a prime. Other lines show points with a(n-1)+a(n-2) equal to a small number times a large prime; e.g. when n>18 and a(n-1)+a(n-2)=6p, a(n) is either 3n+1 or 3n+2. - _Dean Hickerson_, Dec 07 2006

%e A124183 a(6)+a(7)=21. 1,2,4,5,8,10,11,13,16,17,... are the positive integers which are coprime to 21. 13 is the 8th of these integers, so a(8) = 13.

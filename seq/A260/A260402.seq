%N A260402 Numbers which cannot be the largest denominator of an Egyptian fraction for 1.
%C A260402 Complement of A092671.
%C A260402 Contains at all primes and prime powers (A000961).
%C A260402 Martin studies the asymptotic behavior of this sequence: the order of magnitude of its counting function (number of elements below x) is x log log x / log x.

%e A260402 10 is in this sequence because any Egyptian fraction with 1/10 as its term with largest denominator either contains 1/5 as well or not; either way, the resulting sum will have a factor 5 in its denominator (any other term will contribute a multiple of 5 to the numerator of the sum), hence cannot equal 1.

%N A246259 Square array: row n contains in ascending order all natural numbers k for which A246271(k)+1 = n, i.e., numbers m for which we need n-1 additional iterations of A003961, starting from A003961(m), before the result is 1 modulo 4.
%C A246259 The array is read by antidiagonals: A(1,1), A(1,2), A(2,1), A(1,3), A(2,2), A(3,1), etc.
%C A246259 The topmost row, which has row number 1, is the sequence A246261 (numbers n such that A003961(n) is of the form 4k+1), as these are exactly the numbers that do not require any additional iterations of A003961 for the result to be of the form 4k+1 (because it already is of that form).
%C A246259 If a number k occurs in any particular row, then 4k, 9k, 16k, etc. also occur on the same row, because multiplying a number by a perfect square does not affect the result when it is reduced modulo 4.
%C A246259 The array has an infinite number of rows, provided that A246271 is not bounded, because if A246271(n) = k > 0 for some n, then A246271(A003961(n)) = k-1, thus all the preceding rows would also have terms. However, if A246271 really had an absolute maximum m, then we can consider the array to have just m rows. In either case, all the natural numbers occur in it, each just once, thus the sequence forms a permutation of natural numbers.
%C A246259 Applying A003961 to the terms of any row below the first row gives a subsequence of the immediately preceding row.

%e A246259 2 is the least number k such that A003961(k) = 3 modulo 4, but A003961(A003961(k)) = 1 modulo 4 (as indeed A003961(2) = 3, and A003961(3) = 5). Thus A(2,1) = 2.
%e A246259 7 is the second smallest number k satisfying the same property, as A003961(7) = 11 (= 3 mod 4) while A003961(11) = 13 (= 1 mod 4). Thus A(2,2) = 7.
%e A246259 8 is the third smallest number k satisfying the same property, as A003961(8)=27 ( = 3 mod 4) while A003961(27) = 125 = 1 mod 4. Thus A(2,3) = 8.
%e A246259 5 is the least number k such that both A003961(k) and A003961(A003961(k)) = 3 mod 4 but A003961(A003961(A003961(k))) = 1 mod 4. Indeed A003961(5) = 7, A003961(7) = 11 and only at A003961(11) = 13 = 1 mod 4. Thus A(3,1) = 5.

%N A385580 a(n) is the number of ways to partition an n X n X n cube with four noncongruent cuboids of different volumes.
%C A385580 Alternatively, a(n) is the number of ways to decompose (n,n,n) triplet into geometrically feasible four distinct unordered triplets of the form (x,y,z) with no pairs of triplets having equal value for the product x*y*z.
%e A385580 There are A384311(4) = 12 different ways to decompose a 4 X 4 X 4 cube into four noncongruent cuboids, but of those 12 ways, one partition {(4,2,1), (4,2,2), (4,3,2), (4,4,1)} contains two cuboids of volume 16 ((4,2,2) and (4,4,1)) which needs to be excluded. Therefore a(4) = 12-1 = 11.
%Y A385580 Cf. A384311.

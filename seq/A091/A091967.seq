%N A091967 a(n) is the n-th term of sequence A_n, ignoring the offset, or -1 if A_n has fewer than n terms.
%C A091967 This version ignores the offset of A_n and just counts from the beginning of the terms shown in the OEIS entry.
%C A091967 Thus a(8) = 6 because A_8 begins 1,1,2,2,3,4,5,6,... [even though A_8(8) is really 7].
%C A091967 The value a(n) = -1 could arise in two different ways, but it will be easy to decide which. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Nov 27 2016
%C A091967 From _M. F. Hasler_, Sep 22 2013: (Start)
%C A091967 The value of a(91967) can be chosen at will.
%C A091967 Note that this sequence may change if the initial terms in A_n are altered, which does happen from time to time, usually because of the addition of an initial term.
%C A091967 After a(47), currently unknown, the sequence continues with a(48) = A48(47) = 1497207322929, a(49) = A49(48) = unknown, a(50) = A50(49) = unknown, a(51) = A51(50) = 1125899906842625, a(52)=97, a(53) = -1 (since A000053 has only 29 terms). (End)
%C A091967 a(58) = A000058(57) = 138752...985443 (29334988649136302 digits) is too large to include in the b-file. - _Pontus von Brömssen_, May 21 2022

%e A091967 a(1) = 0 since A000001 has offset 0, and begins with A000001(0) = 0.
%e A091967 a(26) = 26 because the 26th term of A000026 = 26.

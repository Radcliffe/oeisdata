%N A362940 Consider the Collatz trajectory from n to 1, assuming the Collatz conjecture is true. Then a(n) = number of terms in the trajectory that are greater than 1 and congruent to 1 mod 3. If n never reaches 1, set a(n) = -1.
%C A362940 The terms in the trajectory counted by a(n) might be called "branch points", since they are exactly the numbers that can be reached in more than one way under the Collatz map. So a(n) is a measure of the "Collatz complexity" of n. The term (with a slightly different definition) was suggested by _Emanuel Landeholm_.

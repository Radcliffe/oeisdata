%N A343302 Numbers k such that k through k+4 are all deficient (in A005100).
%C A343302 Since every multiple of 6 (other than 6 itself) is an abundant number, the maximum length of consecutive runs of deficient numbers is 5.
%C A343302 All terms are congruent to 1 modulo 6.
%C A343302 This is a proper subset of A231626, with the smallest missing term being 347: here only the first members of 5 consecutive deficient numbers in arithmetic progression with common difference 1 are allowed. Terms of A231626 that are not here are listed in A343303.

%e A343302 115 is a term since all of 115, 116, 117, 118 and 119 are deficient.
%e A343302 2989 is not a term since 2989 + 3 = 2992 is an abundant number.

%N A166451 Many interesting things occur with this set of five numbers and its relationship to the sets: {34,35,45,46,56} and {34,35,45,46,56,57,35,45,46,56,57}.
%C A166451 Both sets of 5 numbers have the same sum of 6 cubed = 216; and both sets can be extended to produce a summation of 8 cubed = 512. I wish I could use a whole page to describe all the weird stuff I know about this/these set(s): for example: 34-11=23, 35-16=19, 45-25=20, 46-41=5, and 123-56=67, which is interesting partly because 23+19+20+5=67. The entire collection of relations I know of is much more interesting than just this.
%F A166451 16 = 4th square N, 25 = 5th square N, 25 = 4th centered square N, 41 = 5th centered square N. 3+4+3+5+4+5+4+6+5+6 = 45, 45+5+7 = 57 and 11+123=134=23+19+20+5+67

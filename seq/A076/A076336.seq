%N A076336 (Provable) Sierpiński numbers: odd numbers n such that for all k >= 1 the numbers n*2^k + 1 are composite.
%C A076336 "Provable" in the definition means provable by any method (whether using a covering set or not). - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Aug 03 2024
%C A076336 It is only a conjecture that this sequence is complete up to 3000000 - there may be missing terms.
%C A076336 It is conjectured that 78557 is the smallest Sierpiński number. - _T. D. Noe_, Oct 31 2003
%C A076336 Sierpiński numbers may be proved by exhibiting a periodic sequence p of prime divisors with p(k) | n*2^k+1 and disproved by finding a prime n*2^k+1. It is conjectured by some people that numbers that cannot be proved to be Sierpiński by this method are non-Sierpiński. However, some numbers resist both proof and disproof. - _David W. Wilson_, Jan 17 2005 [Edited by _N. J. A. Sloane_, Aug 03 2024]
%C A076336 Sierpiński showed that this sequence is infinite.
%C A076336 There are four related sequences that arise in this context:
%C A076336 S1: Numbers n such that n*2^k + 1 is composite for all k (this sequence)
%C A076336 S2: Odd numbers n such that 2^k + n is composite for all k (apparently it is conjectured that S1 and S2 are the same sequence)
%C A076336 S3: Numbers n such that n*2^k + 1 is prime for all k (empty)
%C A076336 S4: Numbers n such that 2^k + n is prime for all k (empty)
%C A076336 The following argument, due to Michael Reid, attempts to show that S3 and S4 are empty: If p is a prime divisor of n + 1, then for k = p - 1, the term (either n*2^k + 1 or 2^k + n) is a multiple of p (and also > p, so not prime). [However, David McAfferty points that for the case S3, this argument fails if p is of the form 2^m-1. So it may only be a conjecture that the set S3 is empty. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jun 27 2021]
%C A076336 a(1) = 78557 is also the smallest odd n for which either n^p*2^k + 1 or n^p + 2^k is composite for every k > 0 and every prime p greater than 3. - _Arkadiusz Wesolowski_, Oct 12 2015
%C A076336 n = 4008735125781478102999926000625 = (A213353(1))^4 is in this sequence but is thought not to satisfy the conjecture mentioned by _David W. Wilson_ above. For this multiplier, all n*2^(4m + 2) + 1 are composite by an Aurifeuillean factorization. Only the remaining cases, n*2^k + 1 where k is not 2 modulo 4, are covered by a finite set of primes (namely {3, 17, 97, 241, 257, 673}). See Izotov link for details (although with another prime set). - _Jeppe Stig Nielsen_, Apr 14 2018
%C A076336 Conjecture: if S is a (provable) Sierpiński number, then there exists a prime P such that S^p is also a Sierpiński number for every prime p > P. - _Thomas Ordowski_, Jul 12 2022
%C A076336 Problem: are there odd numbers K such that K - 2^m is a Sierpiński number for every 1 < 2^m < K? If so, then all positive values of (K - 2^m)*2^n + 1 are composite. Also, by the dual Sierpiński conjecture, K - 2^m + 2^n is composite for every 1 < 2^m < K and for every n > 0. Note that, by the dual Sierpiński conjecture, if p is an odd prime and 1 < 2^m < p, then there exists n such that (p - 2^m)*2^n + 1 is prime. So if such a number K exists, it must be composite. - _Thomas Ordowski_, Jul 20 2022
%C A076336 From _M. F. Hasler_, Jul 23 2022: (Start)
%C A076336 1) The above Conjecture is true for Sierpiński numbers provable by a "covering set", with P equal to the largest prime factor of the elements of that set*, according to the explanation from Michael Filaseta posted Jul 12 2022 on the SeqFan mailing list, cf. links. (*More generally: for S^p with any p coprime to all elements of the covering set, but not necessarily prime.)
%C A076336 2) Wilson's comment from 2005 (also the first part, not only the conjecture) is misleading if not wrong because there are provable Sierpiński numbers for which a covering set is not known (maybe even believed not to exist), as explained by Nielsen in his above comment from 2018. (End)

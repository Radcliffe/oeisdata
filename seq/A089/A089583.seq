%N A089583 Numbers n which are a multiple of A068505(n) (= n read in base m+1 where m = largest digit of n).
%C A089583 Note that all single-digit numbers are included as they equal themselves when converted to base b+1. 3 in base 4 is 3 and of course divides evenly into the original value of 3. Note also that all numbers containing the digit 9 can only be interpreted as base-10 numbers, which of course divide themselves. These represent the trivial sequence members. A nontrivial member would be a value like 624, which when interpreted as a base-7 number yields 312 in base 10 which evenly divides 624. See sequence A089584 for the nontrivial members of this sequence.

%e A089583 a(10)=10 because when 10 is interpreted as base 2 and converted back to base 10, the result, 2, divides evenly into 10.

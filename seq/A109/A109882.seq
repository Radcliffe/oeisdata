%N A109882 Palindromes with either no internal digits or all internal digits are 0.
%C A109882 How is this sequence obtained from the given formula? What values for k are used? In particular, how are the terms a(1)-a(10) obtained using this formula? Using an inner loop for m and an outer loop for k, starting at m=1 and k=1, one obtains the infinite subsequence starting 11, 22, 33, 44, .... - _Felix Fr√∂hlich_, Jul 26 2014
%C A109882 Answer, maybe: The formula is only supposed to produce the terms with more than one digit? - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jul 27 2014

%N A166537 Integers whose binary digits "1" define, if sorted into a quadrant shape whose right angle lies in a Go board corner, same colored Go stones that surely live all, but not if any stone is omitted.

%e A166537 2534 has the binary expansion 100111100110. Sorting into a quadrant shape (like in A165197, the least-significant digit into the corner) leads to:
%e A166537 0110
%e A166537 101
%e A166537 01
%e A166537 11
%e A166537 0
%e A166537 If the "0" top left is in a Go board corner and only the 7 digits "1" are Go stones of the same color, then all these 7 stones surely live, no matter where stones or chains of the other color with freedom(s) are. Removal of any of the 7 "1"-stones removes this sureness (for the remaining stones).

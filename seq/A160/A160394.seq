%N A160394 Numbers k = p*q*r (p, q, r prime) congruent to 0 mod p+q+r.
%C A160394 Also numbers k = p*q*r where r = p*q-(p+q) and p, q, r are prime.
%C A160394 For each twin prime pair (q, q+2) the number k = 2*p*(p+2) is in the sequence, since 2+p+(p+2) divides k.
%C A160394 In some cases the factors of k are in arithmetic progression; occurring common differences are 2, 4, 8, 10, 14, 20, 28, 34, 38, 40, 50, 68, 80, 94, 98, ...
%C A160394 All those arithmetic progressions have first term 3, their common differences are the numbers d such that A088420(d/2) = 3. - _Klaus Brockhaus_, May 17 2009

%e A160394 27 = 3*3*3 = (3+3+3)*3, hence 27 is in the sequence; r = 3*3-(3+3).
%e A160394 30 = 2*5*3 = (2+5+3)*3, hence 30 is in the sequence; r = 2*5-(2+5).
%e A160394 165 = 3*5*11 is not a multiple of 3+5+11 = 19, hence 165 is not in the sequence.
%e A160394 627 = 3*11*19 = (3+11+19)*19, hence 627 is in the sequence; r = 3*11-(3+11). The factors 3, 11, 19 are in arithmetic progression (d=8).
%e A160394 40587 = 3*83*163 = (3+83+163)*163, hence 40587 is in the sequence; r = 3*83-(3+83). The factors 3, 83, 163 are in arithmetic progression (d=80).

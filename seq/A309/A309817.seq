%N A309817 a(n) is the index of the n-th nonattacking queen placed by a greedy algorithm on a subset of N^N (see Comments for details).
%C A309817 We consider an infinite chessboard on the subset S of points X = (x_k)_{k>=0} of N^N such that Sum_{k>=0} x_k is finite:
%C A309817 - any point X = (x_k)_{k>=0} of S is uniquely identified by the positive number f(X) = Product_{k>=0} prime(k+1)^x_k (where prime(k) denotes the k-th prime number),
%C A309817 - two distinct points X = (x_k)_{k>=0} and Y = (y_k)_{k>=0} are aligned iff { x_k - y_k, k >= 0 } = { 0, m } for some m > 0.
%C A309817 We traverse S by increasing value of f, and place nonattacking queens as soon as possible; a(n) is the value of f applied to the position of the n-th queen.
%C A309817 This sequence is a generalization of A275897 and of A309362 to a space with infinite dimensions.

%e A309817 We first visit the origin and place our first queen on it.
%e A309817 Hence a(1) = Product_{k>=0} prime(k+1)^0 = 1.
%e A309817 This first queen attacks every point X such that f(X) is in A072774.
%e A309817 The second queen is placed at position (2, 1, 0, 0, 0...); a(2) = 2^2 * 3 = 12.

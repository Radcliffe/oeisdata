%N A123626 Denominators of the convergents of the continued fraction for Pi/sqrt(3) using the classical continued fraction for arctan(x).
%C A123626 It turns out that A123625(n)/a(n) are good approximations to Pi/sqrt(3). In a similar vein R. Apery discovered in 1978 an infinite sequence of good quality approximations to Pi^2. But for Pi itself, it was not until 1993 that Hata succeeded in doing so!

%F A123626 Convergents are given by Pi/sqrt(3) = 2/(1+p_1/(3+p_2/(5+p_3/(7+p_4/(9+...))))) where p_i = i^2/3.

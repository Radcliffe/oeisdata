%N A340984 Number of prime rectangle tilings with n tiles up to equivalence.
%C A340984 Say that a tiling of a rectangle by other rectangles is prime if the only sub-rectangles in the tiling are those formed by a single tile. Say that two tilings are equivalent if there exists an inclusion/overlap-preserving bijection between the vertices, edges, and faces of every rectangle in them.
%C A340984 Problem 69 in Hugo Steinhaus's One Hundred Problems In Elementary Mathematics asks the reader to show that a(3) = a(4) = 0, and that there exist prime dissections for 5, 7, and 8 in which the pieces are of equal area. It cites Czes≈Çaw Ryll-Nardzewski as proving that a(6) = 0, though this is not difficult to show by hand. The book also provides diagrams of both n = 7 solutions and four of the six n = 8 solutions.
%C A340984 Chung et al.'s paper Tiling Rectangles with Rectangles shows that the sequence grows at least as fast as c*2^(n/7) for some positive constant c, and states without proof that it is bounded above by 20000^n.

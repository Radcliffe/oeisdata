%N A086369 Number of factors over Q in the factorization of T_n(x) - 1 where T_n(x) is the Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind.
%C A086369 If p is an odd prime then a(p) = 3.
%C A086369 a(n) is also the cardinality of the set T containing the divisors d of n and those m > 0 satisfying m + d = n (see the R. J. Mathar formula). Another way of defining a(n) is: if S is the set of nondivisors of n such that r and s belong to S if r + s = n, then a(n) = n - |S|. This second 'co-construction' (since n = |T| + |S|) of a(n) via S is more natural than the direct construction via T, as it avoids two ambiguities in the direct approach. Let f be an involutive function f(x) = y mapping distinct nonzero elements x, y of a set to a pair (x,y) in a set of pairs if x + y = n. Considering T, for m and d in T such that m <> n or d <> n, and m <> d, we have f(m) = d; however, n itself is a member of T yet there exists no valid function f'(n) = 0 since 0 is not a member of T; furthermore, if n is even then there is a unique d in T for which we have to define another function f''(d) = d, valid only for d. Whereas considering S, f(r) = s for every r and s in S and therefore f is a surjective map between S and the set of pairs; then, as stated, n - |S| = |T| = a(n). - _Miles Englezou_, Jun 22 2025

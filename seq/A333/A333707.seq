%F A333707 a(n) = Sum_{i=1..floor((n-1)/2)} [d(i) = d(n-i)], where [] is the Iverson bracket and d is the number of divisors of n (A000005).
%e A333707 a(16) = 3; There are 3 ways to write 16 as the sum of 2 distinct numbers with the same number of divisors: 16 = 13+3 (13 and 3 both have 2 divisors), 16 = 11+5 (11 and 5 both have 2 divisors), 16 = 10+6 (10 and 6 both have 4 divisors).

%N A345739 Decimal expansion of the initial acute angle in radians above the horizon of a projectile's velocity such that length of its trajectory is equal to the length of the vertical trajectory with the same initial speed.
%C A345739 A projectile is launched with an initial speed v at angle theta above the horizon. Assuming that the gravitational acceleration g is uniform and neglecting the air resistance, the trajectory is a part of a parabola whose length is L(theta) = (v^2/g) * f(theta), where f(x) = sin(x) + cos(x)^2*log((1+sin(x))/(1-sin(x)))/2 = sin(x) + cos(x)^2*log((1+sin(x))/cos(x)).
%C A345739 This constant is the smaller of the two real roots of f(x) = 1 (the larger root is x = Pi/2, corresponding to a vertical trajectory).
%C A345739 At this angle the trajectory's length is equal to v^2/g, which is also the length of the trajectory at vertical initial velocity (i.e., twice the maximum height). For angles theta below this constant L(theta) has a unique value (i.e., not shared with any other angle).

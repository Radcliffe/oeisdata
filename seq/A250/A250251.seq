%N A250251 Fixed points of A250249 and A250250.
%C A250251 Numbers for which A250249(n) = n (equally: A250250(n) = n).
%C A250251 If n is a member, then 2n is also a member. If any 2n is a member, then n is also a member. If n is a member, then the n-th prime, p_n (= A000040(n)) is also a member. If p_n is a member, then its index n is also a member. Thus the sequence is completely determined by its odd nonprime terms: 1, 9, 15, 25, ..., (A249730) and is obtained as a union of their multiples with powers of 2, and all prime recurrences that start with those values: A007097 U A057450 U A057451 U A057452 U A057453 U ..., etc.

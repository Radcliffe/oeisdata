%N A345395 Composite numbers whose divisors that are larger than 1 are all digitally balanced numbers in base 2 (A031443).
%C A345395 The prime numbers with this property are the digitally balanced primes (A066196).
%C A345395 All the terms are odd, since if k is an even digitally balanced number then its divisor k/2 is not digitally balanced (since it has one fewer 0 in its binary expansion).
%C A345395 Apparently most of the terms are semiprimes (A001358) with 4 divisors.
%C A345395 Terms with 3 divisors, i.e., squares of primes: 145178401 = 12049^2, 155575729 = 12473^2, ...
%C A345395 The least term with more than 4 divisors is 8897396239 = 163 * 929 * 58757, with 8 divisors.
%C A345395 The least term with 6 divisors is 8923691369 = 41 * 14753^2.

%N A266117 Lexicographically first injection of positive integers beginning with a(1) such that a(n)*a(n+1) is a term of A265349, i.e., has no multiple occurrences of any nonzero digit when viewed in factorial base (A007623).
%C A266117 After a(1) = 1, always choose for a(n+1) the least unused k such that in factorial base representation (A007623), the product a(n)*a(n+1) will not show any of the nonzero digits present twice (or more times), regardless of the positions of the digits.

%e A266117 For n = 6, we start searching from the least not yet used number in range a(1) .. a(5) [which is 6, because all the previous terms are fixed] for the first number whose product with a(5) = 5 results a number in A265349.
%e A266117 Multiplying 5 (in factorial base "21") with 6 (in factorial base "100") results 30, which in factorial base is "1100", containing digit "1" twice, thus 6 is disqualified.
%e A266117 Similarly, products 5*7, 5*8 and 5*9 result 35 = "1121", 40 = "1220" and 45 = "1311", where in all cases one of the nonzero digits occur more than once, so 7, 8 and 9 are also all disqualified.
%e A266117 But 5*10 = 50, which has a factorial base representation ("2010") that matches the criterion, thus a(6) = 10.

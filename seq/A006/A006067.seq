%N A006067 Number of ways to quarter an n X n chessboard, with the central square removed for odd n.
%C A006067 To "quarter" means to dissect in 4 parts, identical up to rotation, whose interior must be connected. (I.e., the parts must be polyominoes, any 1 X 1 square of which must share a side with some other 1 X 1 square of the part, unless there's only one.) Solutions that differ only by rotation or reflection are not counted separately.
%C A006067 See A257952 for much more information.
%C A006067 See A272070 for information on odd terms.

%e A006067 For n = 1, we have the 1 X 1 board of which we remove the central square, so nothing is left, and the empty tiling is the only possible tiling.
%e A006067 For n = 2, we have the 2 X 2 board which can only be quartered using four 1 X 1 squares, so a(2) = 1 as well.
%e A006067 For n = 3, the 3 X 3 board without the central square can only be quartered using four 2 X 1 rectangles, so a(3) = 1 as well. (The two different solutions where the top rectangle is aligned to the left or to the right are counted as one, since they only differ by reflection.)
%e A006067 For n = 4 there is the trivial solution using squares, one using straight 4 X 1 tiles, one using T-shaped tiles, and two non-isomorphic ones using L-shaped tiles, one with a central symmetry and one with an axial symmetry:

%N A353778 a(1)=1. If a(n) is a novel term (seen for first time), a(n+1) = number of prior terms a(j) > a(n), 1 <= j <= n-1. If a(n) is a repeat of a term last seen at a(m), m < n, then a(n+1) = n-m-1.
%C A353778 a(n) <= n for all n, with equality when n=1. Similar to A328096 initially, because novel terms are all records to begin with, but diverges when non-record novel terms appear, which produce nonzero following terms.

%e A353778 a(1)=1 is a novel record term, hence a(2)=0. a(3)=1 because a(2)=0 is a novel (non-record) term and only one term, a(1), exceeds it.
%e A353778 a(25) is the first occurrence of 6, so a(26)=2 because two prior terms (9 and 11) are greater than 6.
%e A353778 a(37) is the second occurrence of 4, first seen at a(12), therefore a(38)=37-12-1=24.

%N A159708 Number a of different pairs of primes p,q (not consecutive) and such that p-6,p or p,p+6 are consecutive primes q-6,q or q,q+6 are consecutive primes and p+q=2*n.
%C A159708 Conjecture:if n>4093 there is at least one pair p,q as define such that p+q=2*n

%e A159708 23+47=70,23,29 and 47,53 consecutive primes so a(35)=1 29+41=70 but 41,47 are not consecutive primes gap 6
%e A159708 23+53=76,29+47=76,76=2*38, 23,29 and 47,53 consecutive primes with gap 6, so a(38)=2

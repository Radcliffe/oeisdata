%C A270263 A digit "d" of such an "upside-down" triangle is the result of the absolute digit-differences of the two digits above "d". The last row has one digit. If this digit divides the top row integer, we have a hit. No hit here for 2015 (as 2 doesn't divide 2015) and no hit for 2216 (as 3 doesn't divide 2216), but two hits for 2014 and 2016. No division by zero is accepted. Leading zeros below the first row must be kept if they arise.

%N A358488 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2. Thereafter a(n) is least novel m satisfying: 1. If i = a(n-2) and j = a(n-1) are closed, choose m closed to i and open to j. 2. If i and j are open, choose m closed to h = a(n-3) and open to i + j, unless such a solution does not exist, in which case the constraint that m is closed to h is dropped, leaving a(n) as least novel m open to i + j. See comments.
%C A358488 (i,j) "closed" means gcd(i,j) = 1, whereas "open" means gcd(i,j)>1.
%C A358488 When (i,j) is closed condition 1 applies, and a solution for a(n) exists, since we can choose m as any multiple k*p of a prime p which divides j but not i, where k is any number prime to i.
%C A358488 When (i,j) is open condition 2 applies. If there is a prime p which divides i+j but does not divide h, then a solution for a(n) exists. If there is no such prime (rad(i+j)|rad(h)), then there is no number closed to h and open to i+j, so the requirement for (h,a(n))=1 is dropped, whereby a solution for a(n) is assured because there are infinitely many numbers open to i + j. This happens first at a(32), see Example, and occurs a total of 46 times in the first 16000 terms.
%C A358488 a(n) can be derived from its predecessors as the least novel term satisfying the definition, hence the sequence is infinite.
%C A358488 The primes do not appear in natural order (11 precedes 5). Is this a permutation?

%e A358488 gcd(a(1),a(2)) = 1, so  a(3) = 4, the least novel m prime to 1 but not to 2.
%e A358488 2, 4 have common divisor 2 so a(4) = 3, the least novel m prime to 1 but not to 2 + 4 = 6.
%e A358488 Since 4 and 3 are coprime, a(5) = 9, the least novel m prime to 4 but not to 3.
%e A358488 The first occurrence of i open to j but rad(i+j) | rad(h) happens at the computation  of a(32), since a(29,30,31) = 36,28,26, and rad(36) = rad(54) = 6. Here we drop the requirement for a(n) to be prime to 36, and require only that it is open to 28 + 26 = 54; thus a(31) is 30.

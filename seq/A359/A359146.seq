%N A359146 Divide a square into n similar rectangles; a(n) is the number of different proportions that are possible.
%C A359146 Only the proportions of the rectangles are counted, not how the rectangles are arranged in the square.
%C A359146 The number b(n) of different ways to divide a square into n similar rectangles, up to rotation and reflection, is at least a(n). We have b(1)=1, b(2)=1, b(3)=3, and Baez remarks that b(4) > 11. It would be nice to know more. Is the sequence {b(n)} already in the OEIS?

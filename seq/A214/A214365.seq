%N A214365 Digit-wise Fibonacci: Start with 0,1; then the next term is always the sum of the earliest two consecutive digits not yet summed so far.
%C A214365 Offset chosen in analogy to the classical Fibonacci sequence. But the present sequence has no term larger than 9+9=18.
%C A214365 As observed by H. Havermann in reply to the original post (cf. link), a run of k consecutive 18's will yield a run of (at least) 2k-1 consecutive 9's somewhere later, which in turn will yield (at least) 2k-2 consecutive 18's. Since there are such runs of sufficient length (Z. Seidov pointed out that a(n)=9 for 78532 < n < 78598), the sequence cannot become periodic.
%C A214365 In what precedes, a value of k >= 3 is sufficient for infinite growth. But a run of only three 9's is also sufficient because the 2 consecutive 18's will be followed by a number >= 10, which then yields four 9's and subsequently infinitely long runs of 9's, cf Example.
%C A214365 From _Michael S. Branicky_, Dec 14 2020: (Start)
%C A214365 Likewise, a run of k consecutive 6's will yield (at least) k-1 consecutive 12's, then 2k-3 3's, then 2k-4 6's, leading to infinite growth for k > 4.  Five consecutive 6's first occur at a(17072).
%C A214365 Similarly, a run of k 8's will yield k-1 16's, 2k-3 7's, 2k-4 14's, 4k-9 5's, 4k-10 10's, 8k-21 1's, 8k-22 2's, 8k-23 2's, then 8k-24 8's, leading to infinite growth for k > 3.  Four consecutive 8's first occur at a(9606). (End)

%e A214365 The sequence starts in the same way as the Fibonacci sequence A000045. But after 5+8=13 follows the digit-wise continuation, viz: 8+1=9, 1+3=4, 3+9=12, ... (Due to the presence of 2-digit terms, the summed digits lag more and more behind the correspondingly computed term.)
%e A214365 The first run of 3 consecutive 9's occurs at a(3862)=a(3863)=a(3864)=9, which then yield a(4975)=a(4976)=18, a(4977)=14 and the first run of four 9's at 6392 <= n <= 6395. [_M. F. Hasler_, Feb 17 2013]

%N A335366 Primes preceding the first-occurrence gaps in A014320.
%C A335366 Contains A002386 as a subsequence. First differs from A002386 at a(7)=139. This sequence is a permutation of all positive terms of A000230, in increasing order. See A002386 and A005250 for more references and links.

%F A335366 a(n) = A335367(n) - A014320(n).
%e A335366 The first two primes are 2 and 3, and the first prime gap is 3 - 2 = 1; so a(1)=2. The next prime is 5, and the next gap is 5 - 3 = 2; this gap size has not occurred before, so a(2)=3. The next prime is 7, and the next gap is 7 - 5 = 2; the gap size 2 has already occurred before, so nothing is added to the sequence.

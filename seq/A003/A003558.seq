%N A003558 Least number m > 0 such that 2^m == +-1 (mod 2n + 1).
%C A003558 Multiplicative suborder of 2 (mod 2n+1) (or sord(2, 2n+1)).
%C A003558 This is called quasi-order of 2 mod b, with b = 2*n+1, for n >= 1, in the Hilton/Pederson reference.
%C A003558 For the complexity of computing this, see A002326.
%C A003558 Also, the order of the so-called "milk shuffle" of a deck of n cards, which maps cards (1,2,...,n) to (1,n,2,n-1,3,n-2,...).  See the paper of Lévy. - _Jeffrey Shallit_, Jun 09 2019
%C A003558 It appears that under iteration of the base-n Kaprekar map, for even n > 2 (A165012, A165051, A165090, A151949 in bases 4, 6, 8, 10), almost all cycles are of length a(n/2 - 1); proved under the additional constraint that the cycle contains at least one element satisfying "number of digits (n-1) - number of digits 0 = o(total number of digits)". - _Joseph Myers_, Sep 05 2009
%C A003558 From _Gary W. Adamson_, Sep 20 2011: (Start)
%C A003558 a(n) can be determined by the cycle lengths of iterates using x^2 - 2, seed 2*cos(2*Pi/N); as shown in the A065941 comment of Sep 06 2011. The iterative map of the logistic equation 4x*(1-x) is likewise chaotic with the same cycle lengths but initiating the trajectory with sin^2(2*Pi/N), N = 2n+1 [Kappraff & Adamson, 2004]. Chaotic terms with the identical cycle lengths can be obtained by applying Newton's method to i = sqrt(-1) [Strang, also Kappraff and Adamson, 2003], resulting in the morphism for the cot(2*Pi/N) trajectory: (x^2-1)/2x. (End)
%C A003558 From _Gary W. Adamson_, Sep 11 2019: (Start)
%C A003558 Using x^2 - 2 with seed 2*cos(Pi/7), we obtain the period-three trajectory 1.8019377...-> 1.24697...-> -0.445041... For an odd prime N, the trajectory terms represent diagonal lengths of regular star 2N-gons, with edge the shortest value (0.445... in this case.) (Cf. "Polygons and Chaos", p. 9, Fig 4.) We can normalize such lengths by dividing through with the lowest value, giving 3 diagonals of the 14-gon: (1, 2.801937..., 4.048917...). Label the terms ranked in magnitude with odd integers (1, 3, 5), and we find that the diagonal lengths are in agreement with the diagonal formula (sin(j*Pi)/14)/(sin(Pi/14)), with j = (1,3,5). (End)
%C A003558 Roots of signed n-th row A054142 polynomials are chaotic with respect to the operation (-2, x^2), with cycle lengths a(n). Example: starting with a root to x^3 - 5x^2 + 6x - 1 = 0; (2 + 2*cos(2*Pi/N) = 3.24697...); we obtain the trajectory (3.24697...-> 1.55495...-> 0.198062...); the roots to the polynomial with cycle length 3 matching a(3) = 3. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Sep 21 2011
%C A003558 From _Juhani Heino_, Oct 26 2015: (Start)
%C A003558 Start a sequence with numbers 1 and n. For next numbers, add previous numbers going backwards until the sum is even. Then the new number is sum/2. I conjecture that the sequence returns to 1,n and a(n) is the cycle length.
%C A003558 For example:
%C A003558   1,7,4,2,1,7,... so a(7) = 4.
%C A003558   1,6,3,5,4,2,1,6,... so a(6) = 6. (End)
%C A003558 From _Juhani Heino_, Nov 06 2015: (Start)
%C A003558 Proof of the above conjecture: Let n = -1/2; thus 2n + 1 = 0, so operations are performed mod (2n + 1). When the member is even, it is divided by 2. When it is odd, multiply by n, so effectively divide by -2. This is all well-defined in the sense that new members m are 1 <= m <= n. Now see what happens starting from an odd member m. The next member is -m/2. As long as there are even members, divide by 2 and end up with an odd -m/(2^k). Now add all the members starting with m. The sum is m/(2^k). It's divided by 2, so the next member is m/(2^(k+1)). That is the same as (-m/(2^k))/(-2), as with the definition.
%C A003558 So actually start from 1 and always divide by 2, although the sign sometimes changes. Eventually 1 is reached again. The chain can be traversed backwards and then 2^(cycle length) == +-1 (mod 2n + 1).
%C A003558 To conclude, we take care of a(0): sequence 1,0 continues with zeros and never returns to 1. So let us declare that cycle length 0 means unavailable. (End)
%C A003558 From _Gary W. Adamson_, Aug 20 2019: (Start)
%C A003558 Terms in the sequence can be obtained by applying the doubling sequence mod (2n + 1), then counting the terms until the next term is == +1 (mod 2n + 1).  Example: given 25, the trajectory is (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 7, 14, 3, 6, 12).
%C A003558 The cycle ends since the next term is 24 == -1 (mod 25) and has a period of 10. (End)
%C A003558 From _Gary W. Adamson_, Sep 04 2019: (Start)
%C A003558 Conjecture of Kappraff and Adamson in "Polygons and Chaos", p. 13 Section 7, "Chaos and Number": Given the cycle length for N = 2n + 1, the same cycle length is present in bases 4, 9, 16, 25, ..., m^2, for the expansion of 1/N.
%C A003558 Examples: The cycle length for 7 is 3, likewise for 1/7 in base 4: 0.021021021.... In base 9 the expansion of 1/7 is 0.125125125... Check: The first few terms are 1/9 + 2/81 + 5/729 = 104/279 = 0.1426611... (close to 1/7 = 0.142857...). (End)
%C A003558 From _Gary W. Adamson_, Sep 24 2019: (Start)
%C A003558 An exception to the rule for 1/N in bases m^2: (when N divides m^2 as in 1/7 in base 49, = 7/49, rational). When all terms in the cycle are the same, the identity reduces to 1/N in (some bases) = .a, a, a, .... The minimal values of "a" for 1/N are provided as examples, with the generalization 1/N in base (N-1)^2 = .a, a, a, ... for N odd:
%C A003558    1/3  in base  4  =  .1, 1, 1, ...
%C A003558    1/5  in base 16  =  .3, 3, 3, ...
%C A003558    1/7  in base 36  =  .5, 5, 5, ...
%C A003558    1/9  in base 64  =  .7, 7, 7, ...
%C A003558    1/11 in base 100 =  .9, 9, 9, ... (Check: the first three terms are 9/100 +9/(100^2) + 9/(100^3) = 0.090909 where 1/11 = 0.09090909...). (End)
%C A003558 For N = 2n+1, the corresponding entry is equal to the degree of the polynomial for N shown in (Lang, Table 2, p. 46). As shown, x^3 - 3x - 1 is the minimal polynomial for N = 9, with roots (1.87938..., -1.53208..., 0.347296...); matching the (abs) values of the 2*cos(Pi/9) trajectory using x^2 - 2. Thus, a(4) = 3. If N is prime, the polynomials shown in Table 2 are the same as those for the same N in A065941. If different, the minimal polynomials shown in Table 2 are factors of those in A065941. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Oct 01 2019
%C A003558 The terms in the 2*cos(Pi/N) trajectory (roots to the minimal polynomials in A187360 and (Lang)), are quickly obtained from the doubling trajectory (mod N) by using the operation L(m) 2*cos(x)--> 2*cos(m*x), where L(2), the second degree Lucas polynomial (A034807) is x^2 - 2. Relating to the heptagon and using seed 2*cos(Pi/7), we obtain the trajectory 1.8019..., 1.24697..., and 0.445041....; cyclic with period 3. All such roots can be derived from the N-th roots of Unity and can be mapped on the Vesica Piscis. Given the roots of Unity (Polar 1Angle(k*2*Pi/N), k = 1, 2, ..., (N-1)/2) the Vesica Piscis maps these points on the left (L) circle to the (R) circle by adding 1A(0) or (a + b*I) = (1 + 0i). But this operation is the same as vector addition in which the resultant vector is 1 + 1A(k*(2*Pi/N)). Example: given the radius at 2*Pi/7 on the left circle, this maps to (1 + 1A(2*Pi/7)) on the right circle; or 1A(2*Pi/7) --> (1.8019377...A(Pi/7).  Similarly, 1 + 1A((2)*2*Pi/7)) maps to (1.24697...A (2*Pi/7); and 1 + 1A(3*2*Pi/7) maps to (.0445041...A(3*Pi/7). - _Gary W. Adamson_, Oct 23 2019
%C A003558 From _Gary W. Adamson_, Dec 01 2021: (Start)
%C A003558 As to segregating the two sets: (A014659 terms are those N = (2*n+1), N divides (2^m - 1), and (A014657 terms are those N that divide (2^m + 1)); it appears that the following criteria apply: Given IcoS(N, 1) (cf. Lang link "On the Equivalence...", p. 16, Definition 20), if the number of odd terms is odd, then N belongs to A014659, otherwise A014657. In IcoS(11, 1): (1, 2, 4, 3, 5), three odd terms indicate that 11 is a term in A014657. IcoS(15, 1) has the orbit (1, 2, 4, 7) with two odd terms indicating that 15 is a term in A014659.
%C A003558 It appears that if sin(2^m * Pi/N) has a negative sign, then N is in A014659; otherwise N is in A014657. With N = 15, m is 4 and sin(16 * Pi/15) is -0.2079116... If N is 11, m is 5 and sin(32 * Pi/11) is 0.2817325. (End)
%C A003558 On the iterative map using x^2 - 2, (Devaney, p. 126) states that we must find the function that takes 2*cos(Pi) -> 2*cos(2*Pi). "However, we may write 2*cos(2*Pi) = 2*(2*cos^2(Pi) - 1) = (2*cos(Pi))^2 - 2. So the required function is x^2 - 2." On the period 3 implies chaos theorem of James Yorke and T.Y. Li, proved in 1975; Devaney (p. 133) states that if F is continuous and we find a cycle of period 3, there are infinitely many other cycles for this map with every possible period. Check: The x^2 - 2 orbit for 7 has a period of 3, so this entry has periodic points of all other periods. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Jan 04 2023
%C A003558 It appears that a(n) is the length of the cycle starting at 2/(2*n+1) for the map x->1 - abs(2*x-1). - _Michel Marcus_, Jul 16 2025

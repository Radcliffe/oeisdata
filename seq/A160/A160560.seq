%N A160560 Almost covering numbers.
%C A160560 A collection of congruences with distinct moduli, each greater than 1, such that each integer satisfies at least one of the congruences, is said to be a covering system. Let N be the lcm of these moduli. If modulo N we cannot cover all residues, but can cover all but one residue, then N is an almost covering number.
%C A160560 We denote by T(N) the number of divisors of N and by R(N) the smallest number of uncovered numbers modulo N. Suppose N = p^k * M, where gcd(p,M)=1, p is prime, R(M) = 1, and T(M) = p-1, then R(N) = 1 as well.

%N A164347 The n-th term is the minimum number x such that x/Totient(x) >= n
%C A164347 These numbers are all primorials. Primorials necessarily must be the minimum terms in this sequence (given the nature of Euler's Totient function).
%C A164347 Essentially the same as A091456. - _R. J. Mathar_, Aug 17 2009

%e A164347 2 => 2/ Totient(2) = 2 (so it is both the first and 2nd entry of the sequence) 210 => 210 / Totient(210) = 210/48 >= 4
%o A164347 (PARI) mm=3; n=2; m=1; forprime(x=3,1000, n*=x; m*= (x-1); if (n\m >= mm, mm+=1;print(n))); /* Note: this will generate all terms of this sequence from the 3rd onward. The terms are easy to generate but grow very rapidly */
%Y A164347 Each number n in this sequence is of the form: primorial(x). A164348, the related sequence, contains the x's.

%N A235145 a(n) = Number of steps to reach a fixed point or 2-cycle, when iterating A235027 starting from value n.
%C A235145 Equally, a(n) = minimum number of steps needed to repeat k = A235027(k)(starting from k = n) until A001222(A235027(k)) = A001222(k).
%C A235145 Or in other words, how many times are needed to repeatedly factorize the number, to reverse the bits of each odd prime factor (with A056539) and factorize and bit-reverse the reversed factors again, until the number of prime divisors no more grows, meaning that we have found either a fixed point or entered a cycle of two.

%F A235145 If A235027(A235027(n)) = n, a(n)=0, otherwise 1+a(A235027(n)).
%F A235145 Equally, if A001222(A235027(n)) = A001222(n), a(n)=0, otherwise 1+a(A235027(n)).
%F A235145 a(2n) = a(n), and in general, for composite values a(u * v) = max(a(u),a(v)).
%F A235145 For composite n, a(n) = Max_{p|n} a(p). [The above reduces to this: select the maximal value from all values a(p) computed for primes p dividing n]
%F A235145 For prime p, a(p) = 0 if A056539(p) is also prime (p is 2 or in A074832), otherwise a(p) = 1+a(A056539(p)).
%e A235145 19, '10011' in binary, when reversed, yields '11001' = 25, when factored, yields 5 * 5, ('101' * '101' in binary), which divisors stay same when reversed, thus it took one iteration step to reach a point where the number of prime divisors no more grows. Thus a(19)=1.

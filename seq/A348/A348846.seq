%N A348846 a(1) = 1. For n >=2 the number k in n-th position becomes a(n) only if all terms a(1)..a(n-1) have already been defined, and if the smallest number m, greater than k, not already defined and sharing greatest prime factor (gpf) p with k is reduced to m/p.
%C A348846 A limiting sequence using greatest prime factor. Each number in A000027, in natural order, is considered for admittance to the sequence. A number in n-th position at the start may be reduced several times prior to being admitted as a(n), or may not be reduced at all. Every power 2^k of 2 is reduced eventually to 2, by reduction of A007053(2^(k-1)) even semiprimes, plus 2s from reductions of smaller powers of 2.
%C A348846 Let [p] = {m: m a fixed point with gpf = p}, then [2] = {2}, [3] = {3,9,18,27}, [5] = {5,15,25,40,50,90}, etc. Every odd multiple of odd prime p, up to and including p^2, is necessarily a fixed point. The number of terms in [p] is limited by reduction of q-smooth numbers (q>p) to those having gpf p. Conjecture: For odd prime p, [p] is a finite set with greatest term > p^2, and <= p^3. A variant based on least prime divisors is also possible.

%F A348846 a((2*m+1)*p) is a fixed point for all primes p, with m = 0,1,...,(p-1)/2.
%F A348846 a(2*p) = 2 for all primes p.
%F A348846 a(2^k) = 2 for all k >= 1.
%e A348846 After a(1) = 1, the next eligible number is 2, which becomes a(2) when 4 is reduced to 4/2 = 2.
%e A348846 a(3) = 3 because 6 is reduced to 2.
%e A348846 Next in line is 2 (previously 4), which enters as a(4) when 8 is reduced to 4.
%e A348846 a(5) = 5 when 10 is reduced to 2.
%e A348846 Next in line is 2 (previously 6) which enters as a(6) when 4 (previously 8) is reduced to 2.
%e A348846 a(7) = 7, and so on.

%N A382768 Number of k < n that are coprime to n and neither squarefree nor prime powers.
%C A382768 Let s = A126706, the set of numbers that are neither squarefree nor prime powers.
%C A382768 Let q(k) be the number of terms in A126706 that do not exceed k. For example, q(20) = 3, since s(1..3) = {12, 18, 20}.
%C A382768 a(n) = 0 for n < A382248(n). Only 72 numbers n are such that a(n) = 0, with n = 2310 the largest n such that a(n) = 0.
%C A382768 a(A002110(k)) = 0 for k < 6.

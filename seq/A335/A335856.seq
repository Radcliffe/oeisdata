%N A335856 Squares visited by a chess king on a spirally numbered infinite board where the king moves to the adjacent unvisited square containing the lowest prime number. If no such square is available it chooses the lowest-numbered adjacent unvisited square.
%C A335856 This sequences gives the numbers of the squares visited by a chess king moving on a square-spiral numbered board where the king starts on the 1 numbered square and at each step moves to the adjacent unvisited square containing the lowest prime number. If no adjacent unvisited square contains a prime number then the square with the lowest spiral number is chosen. Note that if the king simply moves to the lowest unvisited number the sequence will be infinite as the king will just follow the square spiral path.
%C A335856 The sequence is finite. After 719 steps the square with number 437 is visited, after which all adjacent neighboring squares have been visited.
%C A335856 Of the 719 visited squares 165 contain prime numbers while 554 contain composites. As the odd numbers are diagonally adjacent in the square spiral the king's path will contain many diagonal steps, often taking numerous diagonal steps is succession - see the attached link image.
%C A335856 The largest visited square is a(709) = 1367. The lowest unvisited square is 33.
%C A335856 The 719 steps until self-trapping occurs are significantly larger than the expected average of 210 moves to self-trapping for a random walk of the king on an infinite chessboard. See the link to the probability density graphs in A323562. - _Hugo Pfoertner_, Jul 19 2020
%C A335856 When the grid points are labeled starting with 0 at the origin, the king gets trapped after 171 moves at (3,0), after going as far as (10,-11) to the south-east and (-8,7) and (-5,8) to the north-east, see A383183. - _M. F. Hasler_, May 13 2025

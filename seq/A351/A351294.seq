%N A351294 Numbers whose multiset of prime factors has at least one permutation with all distinct run-lengths.
%C A351294 First differs from A130091 (Wilf partitions) in having 216.
%C A351294 See A239455 for the definition of Look-and-Say partitions.
%C A351294 The Heinz number of a partition (y_1,...,y_k) is prime(y_1)*...*prime(y_k). This gives a bijective correspondence between positive integers and integer partitions.

%e A351294 For example, the prime indices of 216 are {1,1,1,2,2,2}, and there are four permutations with distinct run-lengths: (1,1,2,2,2,1), (1,2,2,2,1,1), (2,1,1,1,2,2), (2,2,1,1,1,2); so 216 is in the sequence. It is the Heinz number of the Look-and-Say partition of (3,3,2,1).

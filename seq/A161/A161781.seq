%N A161781 Binary encodings of prime constellations.
%C A161781 Each constellation is encoded by means of dividing each of the increments to p in the k-tuple by two, raising two to the power of each and then summing the result. E.g.: (p,p+2,p+6) -> p+(0,2,6) => (0,1,3) -> 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^3 = 11.
%C A161781 Each encoding is unique and so can be reversed. E.g.: 89 = 2^0 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^6 -> (0,3,4,6) => (p,p+6,p+8,p+12).
%C A161781 Those constellations that represent all moduli for all their matching primes p are not counted; for example, encoding #7, which implies (p,p+2,p+4) only matches the prime triple (3,5,7) which is (0,2,1) mod 3, and so is not a valid constellation, and thus 7 is not in the list. Encoding #155 is the first that fails modulo 5, and is also not in the list.

%e A161781 Encoding #1 corresponds to the primes themselves (constellations of one).
%e A161781 Encoding #3 corresponds to the twin primes (p,p+2).
%e A161781 Encoding #5 corresponds to the cousin primes (p,p+4).
%e A161781 Encoding #9 corresponds to the "sexy" primes (p,p+6).
%Y A161781 Cf. A008407, A020497, A094660, A135311. Also compare A014657 which is unrelated but remarkably similar.

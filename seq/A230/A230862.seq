%N A230862 Start with 0; each term when spelled out must start with the last letter of the previous term and must be the smallest such number that is greater than the previous term.
%C A230862 Two variations are possible: Not requiring monotonicity (i.e., the sequence could go: ZerO, OnE, EighT, TeN, NinE, EighteeN, NineteeN, ...), and imposing the additional constraint that the sequence does not stop right after the chosen number (so "NinetY" would be forbidden and "Ninety-onE" should be used instead). See A227865 for a French and A228442 for a German version using such rules. - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 03 2013

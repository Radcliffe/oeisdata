%N A145790 Number of n X n binary arrays symmetric under horizontal reflection with all ones connected only either four adjacent vertically or four adjacent horizontally.
%C A145790 The condition on the "ones" means that the nonzero elements must be grouped together in 1 X 4 or 4 X 1 subarrays, and these subarrays must not touch each other except "diagonally", as is possible for n >= 6 (e.g., ones centered in the top and bottom row and in the left- and rightmost column) but not for n = 5 due to the symmetry condition. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jul 07 2025
%e A145790 From _M. F. Hasler_, Jul 07 2025: (Start)
%e A145790 For n = 4, we have the zero matrix, four matrices with one row of nonzero elements,  three matrices with two rows of nonzero elements that must not touch (rows 1 & 3 or 1 & 4 or 2 & 4), and one matrix with nonzero elements in column 1 & 4, hence a(4) = 1 + 4 + 3 + 1 = 9.
%e A145790 For n = 5, the a(5) = 11 possibilities are the zero matrix and the 2 + 2*2 + 2*2 matrices with 1 or 2 or 3 nonzero columns that can start in row 1 or 2. Due to symmetry restrictions, there cannot be rows of 4 nonzero elements. (End)

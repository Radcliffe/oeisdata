%N A365583 Numbers k with property that k can be represented by the digits present in k using the operations specified in the comment, and requiring fewer digits than the number of digits in k.
%C A365583 The only operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, parenthesizing, and concatenation.
%C A365583 Real and imaginary intermediate values are allowed as long as the final value of the expression is an integer. - _Walter Robinson_, Aug 22 2025

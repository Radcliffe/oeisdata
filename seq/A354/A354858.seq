%N A354858 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest positive number that shares a factor with a(n-1) and both the sum a(n) + a(n-1) is distinct from all previous sums, a(i) + a(i-1), i=2..n-1, and the product a(n) * a(n-1) is distinct from all previous products, a(i) * a(i-1), i=2..n-1.
%C A354858 This sequence uses a combination of the term selection rules of A354755 and A354753. The first forty-five terms are the same as A354755 beyond which they differ; see the examples below. In the first 500000 terms only six terms are prime, 2,3,7,19, with 2 and 3 occurring twice, the last being a(47) = 7. It is unknown if more appear. The only fixed points are 1,2,4,6, and it is likely no more exist.

%e A354858 a(7) = 3 as a(6) = 6, and 3 is the smallest number that shares a factor with 6 and whose sum and product with the previous term, 6 + 3 = 9 and 6 * 3 = 18, have not previously appeared. Note 2 shares a factor with 6 but 6 + 2 = 8, and a sum of 8 has already occurred with a(4) + a(5) = 4 + 4 = 8, so 2 cannot be chosen.
%e A354858 a(46) = 63 as a(45) = 3, and 63 is the smallest number that shares a factor with 3 and whose sum and product with the previous term, 3 + 63 = 66 and 3 * 63 = 189, have not previously appeared. Note 60 shares a factor with 3 but the product 3 * 60 = 180 has already occurred with a(19) * a(20) = 12 * 15 = 180, so 60 cannot be chosen. This is the first term to differ from A354755.

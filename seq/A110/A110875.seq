%N A110875 Minimum positive integer such that length of the gap described at A109322 is exactly n (in contrast to A109322 where the gap length is >= n).
%C A110875 Conjectures and open problems: 1) It is not known whether the sequence is infinite; 2) It is conjectured that for every n there is corresponding a(n). If Conjecture 2) were proved, Conjecture 1) would follow as a direct consequence.
%C A110875 a(50) > 10^10. - _Donovan Johnson_, Jan 25 2012
%C A110875 Note that the sequence appears to undulate with terms that satisfy a(2n-1) < a(2n) < a(2n+1). Is there an explanation? - _Michel Marcus_, Nov 21 2013

%e A110875 a(2)=16 because 16,17 are not contained in values of sigma(k) and 15,18 are; namely: sigma(8)=15 and sigma(10)=18, where sigma(k)=sum of all positive divisors of k.

%N A275667 Number of ON cells after n generations in a 2-dimensional "Odd-Rule" cellular automaton on triangular tiling.
%C A275667 Each triangular tile has 3 neighbors. A cell is ON in a given generation if and only if there was an odd number of ON cells among the three nearest neighbors in the preceding generation.
%C A275667 At the initial moment there is a single ON cell.
%C A275667 Given pattern replicates after a number of generations which is a power of 2 when a(n) = 7.
%C A275667 Number of cells on each even step minus one is divisible by 6.
%C A275667 By analogy with the Ekhad, Sloane, Zeilberger link, one may suppose that using ternary expansion of n, recurrence relations for a(n) can be obtained and proved.
%C A275667 From _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, Aug 04 2016: (Start)
%C A275667 If the first conjecture from the Formula section is true then the fact that the right border of the triangle (see Example) gives A000244 follows directly from it.
%C A275667 If the second conjecture is true then the numbers just before the right border give A102900.
%C A275667 Since the 7 cells which are ON at the beginning of every row are farther and farther away from each other, the n-th term of a row (with offset 0) is a(n)*7 for not very large n.
%C A275667 See also comments to A247666.
%C A275667 (End)
%C A275667 This is ETA rule 170. See the Sadat-Benedek reference for proof of pattern replication. - _Paul Cousin_, Apr 22 2025

%F A275667 a(0) = 1. Conjecture: a(2*t+1) = 3*a(t).
%F A275667 Conjectures: a(8*t+6) = 3*a(4*t+2) + 4*a(2*t), a(8*t+2) = 3*a(4*t) + 4*a(2*t), a(4*t) = a(2*t). These conjectured formulas together give recurrent relations for a(n) for any n. Also, obviously a(2*n) = A247666(n). - _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, Aug 04 2016

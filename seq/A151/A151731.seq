%N A151731 Number of ON states after n generations of cellular automaton based on square grid with each cell adjacent to its eight neighbors.
%C A151731 A cell is turned ON if exactly two of its eight neighbors is ON. An ON cell remains ON forever.
%C A151731 We start with two edge-adjacent ON cells.

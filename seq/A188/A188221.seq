%N A188221 a(n) = [n*r + k*r]-[n*r]-[k*r], where r=sqrt(5), k=1, [ ]=floor.
%C A188221 Differs from A188187 in number of initial zeros.  This sequence yields right-shift sums (introduced at A187950), and A188187 yields left-shift sums (A188014).
%C A188221 (a(n)) is the Sturmian sequence with slope sqrt(5)-2. This number has continued fraction expansion [0; 4,4,4, ...]. It is therefore fixed point of a morphism sigma, which can be found with the Crisp et al link: sigma is given by  0 -> 0001, 1 -> 00010. - _Michel Dekking_, Aug 02 2017
%C A188221 Alternatively, express n-1 in the greedy numeration system based on 1,4,17,72,... (that is, A001076), and run it through the automaton depicted in the links.  If it ends in a state labeled i/j, the n-th term of the sequence is j. - _Jeffrey Shallit_, Mar 03 2025

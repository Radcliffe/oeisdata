%N A236834 Numbers that do not occur as results of "downward" remultiplication (N -> GF(2)[X]) of any number; numbers not present in A234741.
%C A236834 Numbers that do not occur in A234741 (A236841).
%C A236834 This is a subsequence of A236838, thus all terms are GF(2)[X]-multiples of some of the terms of A091214. (Cf. also A236844).
%C A236834 a(5)=91 is the first term that does not occur in A236849. On the other hand, A236849(4)=75, is the first term in the latter which does not occur here.

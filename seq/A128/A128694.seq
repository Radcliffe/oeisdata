%N A128694 Number of groups of order A128693(n).
%C A128694 Number of groups for orders of form 3^k*p, where 1 <= k <= 6 and p is a prime different from 3.
%C A128694 The groups of these orders (up to A128693(84005521) = 3221225379 in version V2.13-4) form a class contained in the Small Groups Library of MAGMA.

%F A128694 a(n) = A000001(A128693(n)).
%e A128694 A128693(9) = 54 and there are 15 groups of order 54 (A000001(54) = 15), hence a(9) = 15.

%N A228236 Numbers k for which a sum k+bitcount(k) can be also obtained as a sum k2 +bitcount(k2) for some other k2<>k . Here bitcount(k) (A000120) gives the number of 1's in binary representation of nonnegative integer k.
%C A228236 In other words, numbers k such that A228085(A092391(k)) > 1.

%e A228236 0 is not in this sequence because the sum 0+A000120(0)=0 cannot be obtained with any other value of k than k=0.
%e A228236 1 is not in this sequence because the sum 1+A000120(1)=2 cannot be obtained with any other value of k than k=1.
%e A228236 2 is not in this sequence because the sum 2+A000120(2)=3 cannot be obtained with any other value of k than k=2.
%e A228236 3 IS in this sequence because the sum 3+A000120(3)=5 can also be obtained with value k=4, as also 4+A000120(4)=5, and thus also 4 is in this sequence.

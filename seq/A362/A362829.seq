%N A362829 Positions in lexicographic order of odd partitions of sufficiently large numbers.
%C A362829 a(n) is the position in lexicographic order of the n-th odd partition of a sufficiently large number k. As long as the number k whose partitions we are examining is large enough, a(n) will exist and won't change for different k. The number of partitions of an odd number, for example, 101 for k=13, will always appear in the sequence, since 13 is the 101st partition in lexicographic order.
%C A362829 Equivalently, positions of partitions with all parts odd among all partitions with no parts of size 1, ordered first by sum, then lexicographically (with the parts in nondecreasing order); or positions of partitions with all parts even among all partitions ordered first by the number of parts plus the sum of the parts, then lexicographically. - _Pontus von Brömssen_, Sep 14 2023

%e A362829 a(1)=1 because 1+1+...+1 (k times) is the first partition in lexicographic order of any positive integer k, and it is odd.
%e A362829 a(2)=3 because 1+1+...+1(k-3 times)+3=k is the third partition of k lexicographically and it is odd.

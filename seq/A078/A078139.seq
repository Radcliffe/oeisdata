%C A078139 From _Hieronymus Fischer_, Nov 11 2007: (Start)
%C A078139 Equivalently, prime numbers which cannot be written as sum of squares of primes (see A078137 for the proof).
%C A078139 Equivalently, prime numbers which cannot be written as sum of squares of 2 and 3 (see A078137 for the proof).
%C A078139 The sequence is finite, since numbers > 23 can be written as sums of squares >1 (see A078135).
%C A078139 Explicit representation as sum of squares of primes, or rather of squares of 2 and 3, for numbers m>23: we have m=c*2^2+d*3^2, where c:=(floor(m/4) - 2*(m mod 4))>=0, d:=m mod 4. For that, the finiteness of the sequence is proved. (End)

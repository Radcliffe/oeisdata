%N A325360 Heinz numbers of integer partitions whose differences are weakly increasing.
%C A325360 The Heinz number of an integer partition (y_1,...,y_k) is prime(y_1)*...*prime(y_k).
%C A325360 The differences of a sequence are defined as if the sequence were increasing, so for example the differences of (x, y, z) are (y - x, z - y). We adhere to this standard for integer partitions also even though they are always weakly decreasing. For example, the differences of (6,3,1) are (-3,-2).
%C A325360 The enumeration of these partitions by sum is given by A240026.

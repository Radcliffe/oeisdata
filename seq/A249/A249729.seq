%N A249729 Numbers not fixed by A250249 and A250250.
%C A249729 Numbers for which A250249(n) <> n (equally: A250250(n) <> n).
%C A249729 If n is a member, then 2n is also a member. If any 2n is a member, then n is also a member. If n is a member, then the n-th prime, p_n (= A000040(n)) is also a member. If p_n is a member, then its index n is also a member. Thus the sequence is completely determined by its odd nonprime terms: 21, 27, 33, 39, 45, ..., and is obtained as a union of their multiples with powers of 2, and all prime recurrences that start with those values. For example, because 21 is present, then 2*21 = 42 is also present. Furthermore, 73 = p_21 is also present, as well as 367 = p_73 as well as 181 = p_42. See also comments at A250251 and A250249.

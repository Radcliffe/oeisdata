%N A258206 Number of strictly non-overlapping holeless polyhexes of perimeter 2n, counted up to rotations and turning over.
%C A258206 Differs from A057779 for the first time at n=12 as here a(12) = 97, one less than A057779(12) because this sequence excludes polyhexes with holes, the smallest which contains six hexagons in a ring, enclosing a hole of one hex, having thus perimeter of 18+6 = 24 (= 2*12) edges.
%C A258206 Differs from A258019 for the first time at n=13 as here a(13) = 312, one less than A258019(13) because this sequence counts only strictly non-overlapping and non-touching polyhex-patterns, while A258019(13) already includes one specimen of helicene-like self-reaching structures.
%C A258206 If one counts these structures by the number of hexagons (instead of perimeter length), one obtains sequence 1, 1, 3, 7, 22, 81, ... (A018190).
%C A258206 a(n) is also the number of 2n-step 2-dimensional closed self-avoiding paths on honeycomb lattice, reduced for symmetry. - _Luca Petrone_, Jan 08 2016

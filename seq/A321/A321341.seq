%N A321341 An unbounded sequence which is 1 infinitely often, with the property that for any four consecutive terms the maximum term is the sum of the two minimum terms.
%C A321341 This sequence was constructed to show that there are many sequences, besides those merging with multiples of the Padovan sequence A000931, with the property that for any four consecutive terms the maximum term is the sum of the two minimum terms.  This refutes a conjecture that was formerly in that entry.

%N A287674 {0->1, 1->001}-transform of the infinite Fibonacci word A003849.
%C A287674 Appears to be the same as A286749 shifted by one place/index. - _R. J. Mathar_, Jun 14 2017
%C A287674 From _Michel Dekking_, Sep 05 2020: (Start)
%C A287674 This sequence is a morphic sequence, i.e., the letter-to-letter image of the fixed point of a morphism mu. In fact, one can take the alphabet {1,2,3,4} with the morphism
%C A287674       mu:  1->12341, 2->1, 3->2, 4->34,
%C A287674 and the letter-to-letter map g defined by
%C A287674       g:  1->1, 2->0, 3->0, 4->1.
%C A287674 Then (a(n)) = g(x), where x = 123411234... is the unique fixed point of the morphism mu.
%C A287674 In my paper "Morphic words, Beatty sequences and integer images of the Fibonacci language" the transform map 0->1, 1->001 is called a decoration. It is well known that decorated fixed points are morphic sequences, and the "natural" algorithm to achieve this yields a morphism on an alphabet of 1+3 = 4 symbols. In general there are several choices for mu. Here we have chosen mu such that it is the SAME morphism as used to generate A286749 as a morphic sequence.
%C A287674 This will make it possible to prove the remarkable conjecture above by _R. J. Mathar_. Note that A286749 is a letter-to-letter projection of the SAME sequence x = 123411234... but by a different letter-to-letter map f:
%C A287674         f: 1->1, 2->1, 3->0, 4->0.
%C A287674 How does one prove that A286749(n+1) = a(n), for n > 0?
%C A287674 The crucial observation is that x is a concatenation of the two words 12341 and 1234. This follows directly from mu(12341) = 12341123412341, and mu(1234) = 123411234. Next one observes that
%C A287674     f(12341) = 11001 = 1g(12341)1^{-1},
%C A287674     f(1234) = 1100 = 1g(1234)1^{-1}.
%C A287674 This property implies then that A286749(n+1) = a(n). (End)

%N A266121 Lexicographically first injection of natural numbers beginning with a(1)=1 such that 1+(a(n)*a(n+1)) is a fibbinary number (A003714), i.e., has no adjacent 1's in its base-2 representation.
%C A266121 It is conjectured that this sequence is not only injective, but also surjective on N, i.e., that it is a true permutation of natural numbers.
%C A266121 A similar sequence, but with condition that "(a(n)*a(n+1)) must be a member of A003714" yields a sequence: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 16, 10, 13, 20, ... (A269361) which certainly is not a bijection, because it contains only terms of A091072.
%C A266121 Also, with above condition and the initial value a(1) = 3 the algorithm generates A269363 which contains only terms of A091067. See also A266191.

%e A266121 After the initial a(1) = 1, for obtaining the value of a(2) we try the first unused number, which is 2, but (1*2)+1 = 3, which in binary is "11", thus 2 is not qualified at this point of time. So next we try 3, and (1*3)+1 = 4, which in binary is "100", and that satisfies our criterion (no adjacent 1-bits), thus we set a(2) = 3.
%e A266121 For a(3), we test with the least unused numbers 2, 4, 5, etc., yielding products (3*2)+1 = 7 = "111", (3*4)+1 = 13 = "1101" and (3*5)+1 = 16 = "10000" in binary, and only 5 satisfies the criterion, thus we set a(3) = 5.

%N A339262 Decimal expansion of the conjecturally maximum possible volume of a polyhedron with 10 vertices inscribed in the unit sphere.
%C A339262 The polyhedron (see linked illustration) has vertices at the poles and two square rings of vertices rotated by Pi/4 against each other, with a polar angle of approx. +-62.89908285 degrees against the poles. The polyhedron is completely described by this angle and its order 16 symmetry. It would be desirable to know a closed formula representation of this angle and the volume.

%N A169647 Primes p such that (p-2)/3 is not a prime number.
%C A169647 The old definition was "Start with the list of primes; accept 2 but remove the list of primes S(2), defined in the comments; accept the next prime (3) but remove the list of primes S(3); repeat".
%C A169647 If p is a prime, S(p) denotes the list of primes {3p+2, 3(3p+2)+2, 3(3(3p+2)+2)+2, ...}, stopping as soon as we reach the first composite number. Thus S(2) = {}, S(3) = {11}, S(5) = {17, 53}, S(7) = {23, 71}, etc.

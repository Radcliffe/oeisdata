%N A383448 Irregular triangle read by rows: T(n,k) (n>=1, k>=0) is the number of trees with n nodes in which there are k edges whose end-vertices have the same degree.
%C A383448 T(n,0) is the number of "peerless" trees on n nodes (see A383447). The row sums are A000055.
%C A383448 For n >= 3, row n has n-2 entries.

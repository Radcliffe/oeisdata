%N A294648 Irregular triangle read by rows, representing a family of sequences L(n), for n=1, 2, 3, ... The sequence L(n) (i.e., the n-th row) is the ordinance of vectors of the n-dimensional Boolean cube (hypercube) {0,1}^n in accordance with their (Hamming) weights, where the lexicographic order is chosen as a second criterion for an ordinance the vectors of equal weights.
%C A294648 The sequences represent the ordinance of vectors of the n-dimensional Boolean cube (hypercube) {0,1}^n in accordance with their (Hamming) weights. The lexicographic order is chosen as a second criterion for the ordinance of the vectors of equal weights. We refer to this order as a Weight-Lexicographic Order (WLO). The WLO is represented by the (serial) numbers of the vectors, instead of the vectors itself. It is well known that if the vectors of {0,1}^n are in lexicographic (standard) order, their numbers form the sequence of natural numbers 0, 1, 2, ..., 2^n-1. So, the WLO means a permutation of the numbers 0, 1, 2, ..., 2^n-1, such that the corresponding vectors are in WLO. This sequence (permutation) is denoted by L(n). It consists of (n+1) subsequences, corresponding to the layers of the Boolean cube.

%F A294648 For n=1, 2, 3, ..., L(n) is defined by the recurrence:
%F A294648 if n=1, L(1)= 0, 1;
%F A294648 else L(n)= l(n, 0), l(n, 1), ..., l(n, k), ..., l(n, n), where the subsequences are defined as follows:
%F A294648    l(n, k)= 0, if k=0, else
%F A294648    l(n, k)= 2^n - 1, if k=n, else
%F A294648    l(n, k)= l(n-1, k), l(n-1, k-1) + 2^{n-1}, for 0 < k < n.
%F A294648 Comments:
%F A294648 1) l(n, k)= l(n-1, k), l(n-1, k-1) + 2^{n-1} means that l(n, k) is a concatenation of two subsequences: l(n-1, k) and l(n-1, k-1) + 2^{n-1}. The second one is obtained after addition of the number 2^{n-1} to each member of l(n-1,k-1).
%F A294648 2) The computing of the members of L(n) resembles the computing (and filling in) the binomial coefficients in Pascal's triangle. The binomial coefficients determine the lengths of the subsequences l(n, k), 0 <= k <= n, in L(n). Thus the beginning of each subsequence can be computed easily.
%F A294648 3) The inductive formula, corresponding to the recurrence, is much more useful for implementations.
%e A294648 The lexicographic order of {0,1}^3 is: (0,0,0), (0,0,1), (0,1,0), (0,1,1), (1,0,0), (1,0,1), (1,1,0), (1,1,1), and the corresponding sequence of (serial) numbers is: 0, 1, 2, ..., 7. The WLO of these vectors is given by the sequence L(3)= 0, 1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6, 7.

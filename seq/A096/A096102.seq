%N A096102 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3; for n > 2: a(n) = smallest (odd) number not occurring earlier such that the sum of each section of odd length >= 3 is prime.
%C A096102 If 1, 3, 7, 13 are taken (rather arbitrarily) as starting terms, then the continuation is 17, 31, 11, 25, 5, 37, 341, 163, 647, 571, 989, 3451, 17669, 206413, 6767, 252289, but no number < 10000000 is suited to continue this sequence further.
%C A096102 There are no further terms. For k to qualify as next term the sums 21+13+k, 7+9+21+13+k and 1+3+7+9+21+13+k have to be prime. One of these sums however is divisible by 3, since 34+k == k+1 (mod 3), 50+k == k+2 (mod 3) and 54+k == k (mod 3). - _Klaus Brockhaus_, Jul 02 2004
%e A096102 1+3+7 = 11, 3+7+9 = 19, 7+9+21 = 37, 9+21+13 = 43, 1+3+7+9+21 = 41, 3+7+9+21+13 = 53 are all prime.

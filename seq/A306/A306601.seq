%N A306601 Let b(1) = 3 and let b(n+1) be the least prime expressible as k*(b(n)-1)*b(n)-1; this sequence gives the values of k in order.
%C A306601 The corresponding primes in order are 5, 19, 683, 1863223, P14, P29, P57, P117, P235, P472, P945, P1893, P3789, P7581, P15164, P30332, P60668, P121339, P242682.
%C A306601 After each iteration the number of decimal digits is roughly twice that of the previous iteration. These primes can generally be easily certified using the N+1 method since all the prime factors for N+1 are known.
%F A306601 Nested f(k) = k*(p-1)*p-1 for p=3. After each iteration the last obtained f(k) is substituted for p. The primes can be certified using OpenPFGW by adding each previous iteration to the helper file.
%e A306601 For p = 3, the smallest k for which f(k) = k*(p-1)*p-1 is prime is 1:
%e A306601 f(1) = k*(p-1)*p-1 = 1*(3-1)*3-1 = 5.
%e A306601 This sets p = 5 for the next iteration for which the smallest k for which f(k) is prime is 1:
%e A306601 f(1) = k*(p-1)*p-1 = 1*(5-1)*5-1 = 19.
%e A306601 This sets p = 19 for the next iteration for which the smallest k for which f(k) is prime is 2:
%e A306601 f(2) = k*(p-1)*p-1 = 2*(19-1)*19-1 = 683.
%e A306601 This sets p = 683 for the next iteration for which the smallest k for which f(k) is prime is 4:
%e A306601 f(4) = k*(p-1)*p-1 = 4*(683-1)*683-1 = 1863223.
%e A306601 This sets p = 1863223 for the next iteration for which the smallest k for which f(k) is prime is 8:
%e A306601 f(8) = k*(p-1)*p-1 = 8*(1863223-1)*1863223-1 = P14.

%N A384033 a(n) is the number of solutions to n = sopfr(k*sopfr(n)) where sopfr(m) is sum of prime factors of m counted with multiplicity.
%C A384033 Also, a(n) is the number of star graph labelings with label n on the leaves of the star such that the label of every vertex equals the sum of prime factors (with repetition) over adjacent vertices and all labels are positive.

%F A384033 a(n) = A000607(n - sopfr(sopfr(n))) if sopfr(sopfr(n)) <= n, otherwise a(n)=0. - _Sean A. Irvine_, Jun 27 2025
%e A384033 A star graph can be defined differently; here, the star graph S_k has a total of k vertices and k-1 leaves.
%e A384033 For all primes n=p as leaf label, the star graph S_2 with 1 central vertex labeled p and 1 leaf labeled p is a solution and the only solution; thus, a(p)=1.
%e A384033   p - p
%e A384033 n=4 as leaf label, works as well with S_2 (2+2=2*2); thus, a(4)=1.
%e A384033   4 - 4
%e A384033 For n=6 as leaf label, there is no respective star graph (as the sum of prime factors is 2+3=5).
%e A384033 n=8 as leaf label can be done as S_4 with the center labeled 18 and the leaves labeled 8 (the prime factor sum for 18=2*3^2 is 2+3+3=8; the prime factor sum for 8=2^3 is 6, adding over all 3 leaves, results in 18); thus, a(8)=1.
%e A384033        8
%e A384033        |
%e A384033   8 -  18 - 8
%e A384033 n=12 is the first labeling with 2 solutions: it can be done with central vertex labeled 35 (S_6) and 42 (S_7); thus, a(12)=2.
%e A384033   The S_6 solution looks like
%e A384033        12   12
%e A384033         \  /
%e A384033     12 - 35 - 12
%e A384033           |
%e A384033          12
%e A384033   as 12=2*2*3 -> 7, 5 leaves sum up to 35 = 5*7 -> 12.

%N A136043 Period-lengths of the base-2 MR-expansions of the reciprocals of the positive integers.
%C A136043 It appears that if p is a prime with 2 as a primitive root (A001122), then a(p)=(p-1)/2. This has been confirmed for primes up to 2000. See A136042 for the definition of the MR-expansion of a positive real number.
%F A136043 a(n) = 1 if n is a power of 2. It seems that otherwise a(n) = A119513(n). - _Andrei Zabolotskii_, Jul 28 2025
%e A136043 In A136042 it is shown that the base-2 MR-expansion of 1/5 is {3,1,3,1,3,1,3,1,...}, with period-length 2, so a(5)=2.

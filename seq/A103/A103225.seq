%N A103225 Number of Gaussian integers z with abs(z) < n and gcd(n,z)=1.
%C A103225 This sequence is much like the usual totient function. That is, it gives the number of Gaussian integers that are relatively prime to n and whose modulus is less than n. When n is a Gaussian prime, A002145, then a(n) = A051132(n)-1.
%C A103225 Four of the dominant lines of the plot appear to align to k(i)*Pi*n^2, with k(i) = 1, 8/9, 1/2, and 4/9. Conjecture: a(n) < Pi*n^2. - _Bill McEachen_, Aug 14 2025

%e A103225 a(2)=4 because 1, -1, i and -i are relatively prime to 2 and have modulus less than 2.

%N A239525 For 0 <= n <= 100, a(n) is smallest integer N such that some positive x/N rounds to n%, with x > 0.
%C A239525 When the fractional part is 0.5, rounding in either direction is allowed.
%C A239525 From _Jonathan Dushoff_, Feb 11 2025: (Start)
%C A239525 The sequence arises when considering how to "reverse-engineer" published percentages: A quoted n percent means that proportion was within at least a total of a(n) things.
%C A239525 Having a(n) based on rounding either way when mid-way between two integer percentages makes the terms agnostic as to what rounding was actually used in the published percentage.
%C A239525 (End)
%F A239525 Find the smallest N such that there is some x > 0 with abs(100*x/N - n) <= 0.5.
%e A239525 a(31)=13 because 4/13 = 0.31 (to two digits after the decimal point).

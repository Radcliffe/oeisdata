%N A197459 Number of free poly-[3.6.3.6]-tiles (holes allowed) with n cells (division into rhombi is significant).
%C A197459 [3.6.3.6] refers to the face configuration of the rhombille tiling. - _Peter Kagey_, Mar 01 2020
%C A197459 If we draw the short diagonals of each tile in the rhombille tiling, we get a subset of edges of the regular hexagonal grid; two edges are adjacent if and only if the corresponding rhombi are adjacent. These are polyedges where angles are constrained to 120 degrees. So there is a 1-to-1 correspondence with the subset of polyedges counted in A159867 after removing polyedges with angles of 60 and/or 180 degrees. - _Joseph Myers_, Jul 12 2020
%C A197459 These are also known as polytwigs, by association with their representation as polyedges. - _Aaron N. Siegel_, May 15 2022

%N A376143 Numbers c such that a + b + c = d are abcd quadruples in the "abcd-conjecture" with a < b < c < d, all |a|, b, c, d are pairwise coprime, the quality q of the quadruple has q > 1, term a = +/- 1 = A376149(n) and term b = A376144(n) (with repetitions and sorted by c then b).
%C A376143 An abcd quadruple is defined as (a, b, c, d) with a+b+c+d = 0, all |a|, |b|, |c|, |d| are pairwise coprime, and radical of a*b*c*d, rad(|a|*|b|*|c|*|d|) < max (|a|, |b|, |c|, |d|).
%C A376143 The quality of an abcd quadruple is q = log(max(|a|,|b|,|c|,|d|))/log(rad(|a|*|b|*|c|*|d|)).
%C A376143 This sequence considers quadruples of the form a = +/- 1 and a+b+c = d with a < b < c < d.
%C A376143 Corresponding numbers for b can be found at A376144 and the sequence indicating whether a is 1 or -1 can be found at A376149.
%C A376143 From _David A. Corneth_, Sep 17 2024: (Start)
%C A376143 All of a, b, c, d in a valid quadruple are odd. Proof: As a + b + c = d, a + b + c + d = 2d is even. Hence an even number of numbers in {a, b, c, d} is odd and as there is an even number of numbers in {a, b, c, d} consequently an even number of them is even.
%C A376143 If more than 0 of them is even then at least two of them are even and not all of {a, b, c, d} are pairwise coprime. Therefore exactly 0 of them are even i.e. they are all odd. (End)

%e A376143 a(2) = 2375 because the second occurrence of these abcd quadruples with a = +/- 1 is (-1, 27, 2375, 2401) with c = 2375. As prime factors of the form a+d = b+c, we have 1 + 7^4 = 3^3 + 5^3 * 19.
%e A376143 a(4) = 11881 because the fourth occurrence of these abcd quadruples with a = +/- 1 is (1, 25, 11881, 11907) with c = 11881. As prime factors of the form a+b+c = d, we have 1 + 5^2 + 109^2 = 3^5 * 7^2.

%e A376143 Suppose we look for terms <= 2500. We could iterate over squarefree numbers <= 2500. One of the numbers we will see is 285.
%e A376143 List its prime factors; {3,5,19}.
%e A376143 Make all pairs of sets of distinct prime factors.
%e A376143 These are {{{3}, {5, 19}}, {{5}, {3, 19}}, {{19}, {3,5}}}. One of the pairs we will check is {{3}, {5, 19}}. For each set in it, list all numbers of the form 3^k <= 2500 and 5^m*19^t <= 2500 with k, m, t >= 1. These are (3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729, 2187) and (95, 475, 1805, 2375). Check all pairs from the Cartesian product of these numbers. One pair is (27, 2375).
%e A376143 The smallest is a candidate for b, the largest for c. See if either (or both) of candidate values a in {-1, 1} give a quadruple (a, b, c, d) (where d = a + b + c meeting the quality requirements and pairwise coprimeness (and d <= 2500)). For this example we find the quadruple (-1, 27, 2375, 2401). (End)

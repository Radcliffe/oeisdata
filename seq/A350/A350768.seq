%N A350768 a(1)=1. Thereafter, if a(n) is a term that has appeared exactly k times prior to and including itself then a(n+1) is the number of terms prior to and including a(n) which have appeared exactly k times.
%C A350768 In other words: If a(n) has appeared k>=1 times, and there are m>=1 other numbers which (prior to a(n)) have also appeared k times, then a(n+1)=k*m.
%C A350768 Conjecture: Every positive integer appears finitely many times (1 appears three times, 2 eight times, 3 seven times, and so on). It seems that after a number j has appeared for the final time in the sequence, it remains possible for subsequent terms to appear j times, but not in isolation, meaning that there are g>1 other numbers which have also appeared j times, so that the next term becomes j*m, rather than j. Henceforth j cannot appear again, but multiples of j can, until they too cease to appear.
%C A350768 Let c(m) represent the number of times m appears in a(1..n) and q(w) the number of c(m) = w. Therefore the sequence may be defined alternatively as a(1) = 1; a(n) = q(c(a(n)))*c(a(n)). - _Michael De Vlieger_, Jan 14 2022

Records are annotated in red, last occurrence of m appears in blue, and we highlight the first appearance of m in gold, second in green, and third in cyan. This is an attempt to explain striations in large-scale scatterplots.

As expected, as n increases, m appears increasingly often, however, some m appear more often than others.

Generally, small m have a lower frequency q(m) than do higher m, but the gradient is impure.

%e A350768 a(1)=1 is a first occurrence, so a(2) is the number of first occurrences prior to and including a(1), thus a(2)=1. a(2) is a term seen twice and no other term has been seen twice, so a(3)=2. Since a(3)=2 is a novel term, a(4)=1, the number of terms seen exactly once so far.

%N A145384 The number of terms of A050791 bracketed by successive terms of A141326.
%C A145384 A141326 is a simply generated subsequence of A050791 and by observation it forms a natural measure of the parent sequence. The first several hundred terms of the parent sequence not belonging to A141326 are bracketed into groups with a small integral number of terms ( including 0 ) by the successive terms of the subsequence, A141326.
%C A145384 a(107),a(108) are the first occurrence of 2 consecutive 0's and a(119),a(120),a(121) are the first occurrence of 3 consecutive 0's. This leads to the following conjecture:
%C A145384 <a(n)> -> 0 as n ->inf
%C A145384 where <a(n)> = ( sum m=1,n of a(m) )/n

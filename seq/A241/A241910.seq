%N A241910 After a(1)=0, numbers 0 .. bigomega(n)-1, followed by numbers 0 .. bigomega(n+1)-1, etc., where bigomega(n)=A001222(n) is the number of prime factors of n (with repetition).

%e A241910 Viewed as an irregular table, the sequence is constructed as:
%e A241910 "Row"
%e A241910   [1] 0; (by convention, a(1)=0)
%e A241910   [2] 0; (because bigomega(2)=1, we have here terms from 0 to 0)
%e A241910   [3] 0; (same with 3, bigomega(3)=1)
%e A241910   [4] 0, 1; (as bigomega(4)=2, we have terms from 0 to 2-1)
%e A241910   [5] 0;
%e A241910   [6] 0, 1;
%e A241910   [7] 0;
%e A241910   [8] 0, 1, 2; (as bigomega(8)=3, we have terms from 0 to 3-1).

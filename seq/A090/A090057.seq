%N A090057 Numbers n divisible by exactly two nontrivial permutations (rearrangements) of the digits of n.
%C A090057 Trivial permutations are identified as (1) permutation = n, or (2) when n mod 10=0, permutations of n's digits which result in shifting only trailing zeros to the most significant side of n where they drop off, such that permutation = n/10^z, where z <= the number of trailing zeros of n. So if n were 1809000, the following permutations would be excluded as trivial: 1809000, 0180900, 0018090, 0001809.

%e A090057 a(3)=3105 because 3105 is divisible by both 135 and 1035, two nontrivial permutations of 3105. a(8)=9207 because 9207 is divisible by both 279 and 297, two nontrivial permutations of 9207.

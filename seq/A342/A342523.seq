%N A342523 Heinz numbers of integer partitions with weakly increasing first quotients.
%C A342523 Also called log-concave-up partitions.
%C A342523 The Heinz number of a partition (y_1,...,y_k) is prime(y_1)*...*prime(y_k). This gives a bijective correspondence between positive integers and integer partitions.
%C A342523 The first quotients of a sequence are defined as if the sequence were an increasing divisor chain, so for example the first quotients of (6,3,1) are (1/2,1/3).

%e A342523 The prime indices of 60 are {1,1,2,3}, with first quotients (1,2,3/2), so 60 is not in the sequence.
%e A342523 Most small numbers are in the sequence, but the sequence of non-terms together with their prime indices begins:

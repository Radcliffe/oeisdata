%N A073758 Smallest number that is neither a divisor of nor relatively prime to n, or 0 if no such number exists.
%C A073758 Original name: Smallest number of "unrelated set" belonging to n [=URS(n)]. Least number, neither divisor nor relatively prime to n. Or a(n)=0 if unrelated set is empty.
%C A073758 From _Michael De Vlieger_, Mar 28 2016 (Start):
%C A073758 Primes n have no unrelated numbers m < n since all such numbers are coprime to n.
%C A073758 Unrelated numbers m must be composite since primes must either divide or be coprime to n.
%C A073758 m = 1 is not counted as unrelated as it divides and is coprime to n.
%C A073758 a(4) = 0 since 4 is the smallest composite and unrelated numbers m with respect to n must be composite and smaller than n. All other composite n have at least one unrelated number m.
%C A073758 The test for unrelated numbers m that belong to n is 1 < gcd(m, n) < m.
%C A073758 a(6) = A073759(6), a(8) = A073759(8), a(9) = A073759(9). (End)

%e A073758 a(20) = 6 since it is the smallest term of the set of numbers m that neither divide nor are coprime to 20, i.e., {6, 8, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18}.

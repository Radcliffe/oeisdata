%N A180414 Number of different resistances that can be obtained by combining n one-ohm resistors.
%C A180414 In "addendum" J. Karnofsky stated the value a(15) = 1064833. In contrast to the terms up to and including a(14), which could all be confirmed, an independent calculation based on a list of 3-connected simple graphs resulted in the corrected value a(15) = 1064835. - _Hugo Pfoertner_, Dec 06 2020
%C A180414 See A337517 for the number of different resistances that can be obtained by combining /exactly/ n one-ohm resistors. The method used by Andrew Howroyd (see his program in the link section) uses 3-connected graphs with one edge (the 'battery edge') removed. - _Rainer Rosenthal_, Feb 07 2021

%F A180414 a(n) = A174284(n) + 1 for n <= 7, a(n) > A174284(n) + 1 otherwise. - _Hugo Pfoertner_, Nov 01 2020
%F A180414 a(n) is the number of elements in the union of the sets SetA337517(k), k <= n, counted by A337517. - _Rainer Rosenthal_, Feb 07 2021
%e A180414 a(n) counts all resistances that can be obtained with fewer than n resistors as well as with exactly n resistors. Without a resistor the resistance is infinite, i.e., a(0) = 1. One 1-ohm resistor adds resistance 1, so a(1) = 2. Two resistors in parallel give 1/2 ohm, while in series they give 2 ohms. So a(2) is the number of elements in the set {infinity, 1, 1/2, 2}, i.e., a(2) = 4. - _Rainer Rosenthal_, Feb 07 2021

%N A056760 Integers with exactly 2 prime divisors such that the cube of the number of divisors exceeds the number.
%C A056760 Numbers with 8 prime divisors also occur among cases satisfying relation d^3>n.
%C A056760 Prime divisors are counted without multiplicity. - _Harvey P. Dale_, May 14 2012

%F A056760 Integers k = (p^w)*(q^u) such that d(k)^3 > k, where d(k) = A000005(k).
%e A056760 The sequence is finite and almost surely complete. Between 270000 and 17000000 no more cases were found. The last 3 entries are: 165888, 186624, 248832. E.g. k = 1024*343 = 248832, with 66 divisors and d^3 = 287496 > 248832.

%N A122036 Odd abundant numbers (A005231) which are not in A136446, i.e., not sum of some of their proper divisors > 1.
%C A122036 It is conjectured that there are no odd weird numbers (A006037), i.e., that all odd abundant numbers (A005231) are pseudoperfect (A005835); this sequence lists those which are not equal to the sum of a subset of proper divisors > 1.

%e A122036 a(1) = 351351 = 3^3 * 7 * 11 * 13^2 is the sum of all its 47 proper divisors (including 1) except 7 and 11, but it is not possible to get the same sum without using the trivial divisor 1: The sum of all proper divisors *larger than 1* yields 351351 + 7 + 11 - 1 = 351351 + 17, and it is not possible to get 17 as sum of a subset of {3, 7, 9, 11, 13, 21, ...}. Thus, 351351 is not in A136446, and therefore in this sequence. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jul 16 2016, edited Mar 15 2021

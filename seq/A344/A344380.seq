%N A344380 Complement of A344378 in A172186.
%C A344380 Terms belong to A172186 but not to A344378. Even though a(n)*(a(n)+1)*(2*a(n)+1) is squarefree, Sum_{j=1..a(n)} j^(2k) always has a prime divisor which is smaller than 2*a(n)+3, whatever k. For the integers m such that m*(m+1)*(2*m+1) is nonsquarefree, Sum_{j=1..m} j^(2k) always has a prime divisor which is smaller than 2*m+3, whatever k, because it is divisible by any prime p such that p^2 divides m*(m+1)*(2*m+1).

%e A344380 14 belongs to the sequence, because it is squarefree, and Sum_{j=1..14} j^(2k) is always divisible by 29 when 14 does not divide k, and when 14 divides k, it is divisible by 13 or by 7.

%N A361625 Number of free polyominoes with checkerboard-pattern-colored vertices with n cells.
%C A361625 Also, number of polysticks of size n (see A019988), with the requirement that any two sticks are connected by a sequence of adjacent, alternately horizontal and vertical sticks. - _Pontus von Br√∂mssen_, Sep 01 2023

%F A361625 a(n) = 2 * A000105(n) - (A351190(n) + A351142(n) + A351127(n) + A349328(n) + A346799(n/2) + A234008(n/2)), where the last two terms are only included if 2|n. I.e., every free polyomino is counted twice here unless it is symmetric with respect to a Pi/2 rotation centered at a cell, or a Pi rotation centered at an edge, or a reflection with respect to an axis parallel to the grid and passing through cells.
%e A361625 There are 2 ways to color the 4 corners of a monomino with black and white colors alternatingly, but they are related by a rotation or a reflection, so a(1) = 1. a(2) is also 1 because the two ways to color the 6 vertices of a domino with black and white colors in the checkerboard pattern are related to each other by a reflection or a rotation. The same is true for the stick tromino, but the two ways to color the 8 vertices of the L-tromino are inequivalent, so a(3) = 3.
%e A361625 For n = 3, the a(3) = 3 allowed polysticks are:

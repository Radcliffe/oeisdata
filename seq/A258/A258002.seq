%N A258002 Capped binary boundary codes for holeless strictly non-overlapping polyhexes (all orientations and rotations included).
%C A258002 The sequence consists of those terms of A255571 whose every A080541/A080542-rotation is also a term of A255571 and in their binary representation the number of 1's is larger than the number of 0's. More precisely, after the initial term a(0)=1 (which stands for an empty path) each term has seven more 1's than 0's in their binary representation, i.e., A037861(a(n)) = -7 for all n >= 1.
%H A258002 Antti Karttunen, <a href="/A258002/b258002.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 0..20622; all terms up to the binary width 26+1, solutions up to 26 edges</a>
%e A258002 8167737748888 is included in the sequence, as it encodes a 42-edge polyhex pattern which is composed of two seven-hex "crowns" connected by a snake-like "S-piece".

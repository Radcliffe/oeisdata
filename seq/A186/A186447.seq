%C A186447 A simple unpredictable binary sequence.
%C A186447 Conjecture: All finite binary words appear in the sequence infinitely many times.
%C A186447 The sequence appears to have a slight bias towards 0.  From n=0 through n=999, there are 510 1's.  But after 10000 terms, the sequence has produced only 4900 1's.  And after 10000000 terms, the sequence has produced 4910267 1's.
%e A186447 For n=20, a(n)=a(10) XOR a(floor(20/3)+a(19)*5)
%e A186447 =0 XOR a(11)=0 XOR 0 =0.

%N A327883 a(0)=a(1)=0; thereafter a(n+1) is the index of the earliest as yet unused occurrence of a(n) if a(n) has occurred before; otherwise a(n+1) = a(a(n)-1). Once an occurrence of a(n) has been used it cannot be used again.
%C A327883 For n > 2, a(n+1) is either the index or repeat of an earlier term (see Name). Hence terms are referred to here as being "index" or "repeat" respectively. Starting from a(3)=1, index and repeat terms occur alternatively throughout the sequence.
%C A327883 a(n) < n for all n >= 0. For k >= 2, numbers 0,1,...,2^k-2 occur as terms in the interval between a(2^k-2) = 0 and a(2^(k+1)-2) = 0; see Formula (e.g., k = 2 --> 0,1,2 occur between a(2) and a(6); k = 3 --> 0,1,..,6 occur between a(6) and a(14)). Thus every integer >= 0 occurs infinitely many times in the sequence.
%C A327883 There appears to be a proper copy subsequence given by a(4*m+2) = a(m-1); m >0 (noticed by Carl J Love). There may be other (independent) copies to be found (e.g. by selecting terms sequentially, one from each of the above mentioned intervals). A family of sequences similar to this one can be described using the same rule as above, with offset k >= 0 and initial terms a(k) = a(k+1) = k. Conjecture: Every such sequence contains a proper copy of itself as a(4*m+2+k) = a(m+k-1).
%C A327883 Index terms > 0 are 1,2,4,3,6,5,10,9,8,7,14,13,... (see A132666). Repeat terms from a(4)=0 are 0,0,1,0,2,0,3,1,4,0,5,2,6,0,7,... (union of the nonnegative integers interleaved with the copy subsequence described above).
%C A327883 For any n >= 0, a k >= 0 exists such that a^k(n)=0 (e.g., n=5 -> k=2; a^2(5)=0).
%C A327883 Replacing a(a(n)-1) with a(a(n)+1) in the Name produces A025480 with 0 prepended.

%F A327883 (m-th)-level (dependent) copy subsequence: a(k) = a(4^m*(k+2) - 2), m >= 1, k >= 0.
%e A327883 a(2) = 0 since a(1) = 0 was last seen as a(0); a(3) = 1 since a(2) = 0 was last seen as a(1); a(4) = 0 since a(3) = 1 has not been seen before, so a(4) = a(a(3)-1) = a(0) = 0; a(327883)=163736.

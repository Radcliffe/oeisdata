%N A160557 Positive integers b for which the Diophantine equation f = (b^(2n) - b^n + 8n^2 - 2) / (2n * (2n + 1)) has at least ten solutions for n <= 10000, n is never divisible by 5, and 2n + 1 is prime.
%C A160557 When b = 2, there are 105 solutions less than 10000, and in this case, the sequence of n is dominated by primes: only five of these are composite. The average difference between successive composite terms is near the magnitude of n. n and 2n + 1 account for roughly 3% of primes less than 20 billion. For other bases, n is almost always composite.
%C A160557 There are 31 solutions when b = 1286.

%N A383422 The infinite Lucas word; the limiting word generated by s(0) = 0, s(1) = 011, and s(n) = s(n-1)s(n-2).
%C A383422 The lengths of initial words generated by s(0) = 0, s(1) = 011, and s(n) = s(n-1)s(n-2) are the Lucas numbers, A000032, in analogy to lengths of initial words generated by s(0) = 0, s(1) = 01, and s(n) = s(n-1)s(n-2), which are the Fibonacci numbers, A000045. See A003849, especially the cross-reference section, for variants of the infinite Fibonacci word that are analogous to variants of the infinite Lucas word.
%F A383422 In the infinite Fibonacci word A003849, replace each 1 by 11.
%F A383422 a(n) = 1 - A287772(n+1) for n>=0.
%e A383422 The initial words are 0, 011, 0110, 0110011, 01100110110, ...  with  lengths  1, 3, 4, 7, 11, ... .

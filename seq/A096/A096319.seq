%N A096319 Final digit of the sum of the first n primes.
%C A096319 Previous name: "Given the number wheel 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 then starting with 0, the next number is a prime p number of positions from the previous number found, for p=2,3,...".
%C A096319 Conjecture: This sequence carried to infinity is non-repeating and non-terminating. If we concatenate the numbers and introduce a decimal point somewhere, we will get an irrational number.
%F A096319 a(n) = (a(n-1) + prime(n)) mod 10, with a(0) = 0.
%F A096319 a(n) = A007504(n) mod 10. - _Michel Marcus_, Mar 09 2025
%e A096319 Imagine a number wheel 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 like the numbers on an odometer. The first number in the wheel is 0. Counting from 0, the next number is 2 positions beyond 0 which is 2; counting 3 positions from 2, we get 5; counting 5 positions from 5 (when we hit 9, we go to 0) we get 0. 2,5,0 are the first 3 terms in the table.

%N A384102 Least x in absolute value, such that there exists y, |x| >= |y| > 0, such that n = |6xy + x + y|, or 0 if no such x exists. Choose x > 0 if x and -x are both possible.
%C A384102 (6n-1, 6n+1) are twin primes iff a(n) = 0, that is, if there are no nonzero integers x, y such that n = |6xy + x + y|. (These n are listed in A002822, the complement is A067611.)

%e A384102 For n = 1, 2 and 3, there are no nonzero x,y such that n = |6xy + x + y|, and (6n-1, 6n+1) = (5, 7), (11, 13) and (17, 19) are indeed twin primes.
%e A384102 For n = 4 we have x = y = -1 such that |6xy + x + y| = |6 - 1 - 1| = 4 and (23, 25) is indeed not a twin prime pair.

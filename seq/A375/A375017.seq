%N A375017 Squarefree numbers k such that k is the area of a rational isosceles triangle.
%C A375017 All rational isosceles triangles are the join of two identical rational right triangles along one of their common legs. Therefore, for any g, a squarefree congruent number, it can be the area of the right triangle creating a rational isosceles triangle with area 2g. If g is odd then the rational isosceles triangle will have squarefree k = 2g. If g is even then the rational isosceles triangle can be reduced by a factor 4 to give a squarefree value for k = g/2.

%e A375017 The congruent number 5 can create a rational right triangle with sides (9/6, 40/6, 41/6) and squarefree area 5. This can create a rational isosceles triangle with sides (3, 41/6, 41/6) or (80/6, 41/6, 41/6) with squarefree area 10.
%e A375017 However the congruent number 6 can create a rational right triangle with sides (3, 4, 5) and squarefree area 6. This can create a rational isosceles triangle with sides (5/2, 5/2, 3) or (4, 5/2, 5/2) with squarefree area 3.

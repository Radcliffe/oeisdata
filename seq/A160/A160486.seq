%N A160486 Triangle of polynomial coefficients related to the o.g.f.s. of the RBS1 polynomials.
%C A160486 As we showed in A160485 the n-th term of the coefficients of matrix row BS1[1-2*m,n] for m = 1 , 2, 3, .. , can be generated with the RBS1(1-2*m,n) polynomials.
%C A160486 We define the o.g.f.s. of these polynomials by GFRBS1(z,1-2*m) = sum(RBS1(1-2*m,n)*z^(n-1), n=1..infinity) for m = 1, 2, 3, .. . The general expression of these o.g.f.s. is GFRBS1(z,1-2*m) = (-1)*RB(z,1-2*m)/(z-1)^m.
%C A160486 The RB(z,1-2*m) polynomials lead to a triangle that is a subtriangle of the 'double triangle' A008971. The even rows of the latter triangle are identical to the rows of our triangle.
%C A160486 The Maple program given below is derived from the one given in A008971.
%e A160486 The first few rows of the triangle are:
%e A160486 [1]
%e A160486 [1, 1]
%e A160486 [1, 18, 5]
%e A160486 [1, 179, 479, 61]
%e A160486 [1, 1636, 18270, 19028, 1385]
%e A160486 The first few RB(z,1-2*m) polynomials are:
%e A160486 RB(z,-1) = 1
%e A160486 RB(z,-3) = z+1
%e A160486 RB(z,-5) = z^2+18*z+5
%e A160486 RB(z,-7) = z^3+179*z^2+479*z+61
%e A160486 The first few GFRBS1(z,1-2*m) are:
%e A160486 GFRBS1(z,-1) = (-1)*(1)/(z-1)
%e A160486 GFRBS1(z,-3) = (-1)*(z+1)/(z-1)^2
%e A160486 GFRBS1(z,-5) = (-1)*(z^2+18*z+5)/(z-1)^3
%e A160486 GFRBS1(z,-7) = (-1)*(z^3+179*z^2+479*z+61)/(z-1)^4

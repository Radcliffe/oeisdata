%N A283793 Number of elements formable in <= n steps, starting with 4 elements, combining 2 elements into a new element at each step.
%C A283793 In a game such as Doodle God (see links), you start with Earth, Air, Fire and Water, and combine them two at a time (including combining an element with itself) into new elements. A(n) is the hypothetical maximum number of different possible elements you could reach from clicking at most n times.
%C A283793 This list is akin to A006894, which is the sequence if we started with 1 element instead of 4.

%F A283793 a(n) = 4 + T(a(n-1)) where T(m) is the m-th triangular number.
%e A283793 Starting with {A, B, C, D}, we can make {AA, AB, AC, AD, BB, BC, BD, CC, CD, and DD}.  The union of these two sets has cardinality 14 = a(1).

%N A175381 A positive integer k is included if all positive integers that, when written in binary, occur as substrings in binary k divide k.
%C A175381 This is the complement of sequence A175382.
%C A175381 This sequence is infinite (because it contains all powers of 2).
%C A175381 The union of powers of 2 and numbers of the form 2^n + 2^k, where floor(n/2) <= k < n. - _Ivan Neretin_, Nov 24 2016

%e A175381 20 in binary is 10100. The positive integers that, when written in binary, occur as substrings in 10100 are: 1 (1 in binary), 2 (10 in binary), 4 (100 in binary), 5 (101 in binary), 10 (1010 in binary), and 20 (10100 in binary.) Since 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20 each are a divisor of 20, then 20 is in this sequence.

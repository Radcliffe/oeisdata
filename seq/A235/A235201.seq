%N A235201 Self-inverse and multiplicative permutation of integers: a(0)=0, a(1)=1, a(2)=2, a(3)=4 and a(4)=3, a(p_i) = p_{a(i)} for primes with index i > 2, and for composites > 4, a(u * v) = a(u) * a(v) for u, v > 0.
%C A235201 The permutation satisfies A000040(a(n)) = a(A000040(n)) for all positive n except n=2, and is self-inverse. It swaps 3 & 4, maps any prime p_i with index i > 2 to p_{a(i)}, and lets the multiplicativity take care of the rest.
%C A235201 This can be viewed also as a "signature-permutation" for a bijection on non-oriented rooted trees, mapped through the Matula-Goebel numbers (cf. A061773). This bijection will swap the subtrees encoded by numbers 3 and 4, wherever they occur as the terminal configurations anywhere in the tree:
%C A235201 ....................
%C A235201 .o..................
%C A235201 .|..................
%C A235201 .o.............o...o
%C A235201 .|..............\./.
%C A235201 .x.....<--->.....x..
%C A235201 .3...............4..
%C A235201 That is, the last two edges of any branch which ends with at least in two edges long unbranched stem, will be changed to a V-branch (two single edges in parallel). Vice versa, any terminal configuration in the tree that consists of more than one single edges next to each other (in "parallel") will be transformed so that maximal even number (2k) of those single edges will be combined to k unbranching stems of two edges, and an extra odd edge, if present, will stay as it is.
%C A235201 This permutation commutes with A235199, i.e. a(A235199(n)) = A235199(a(n)) for all n. This can be easily seen, when comparing the above bijection to the one described in A235199. Composition A235199 o A235201 works as a "difference" of these two bijections, swapping the above subconfigurations only when they do not occur alone at the tips of singular edges. (Which cases are encoded by Matula-Goebel numbers 5 and 7, the third and fourth prime respectively).
%C A235201 Permutation fixes n! for n=0, 1, 2, 4, 7.
%C A235201 Note that a(5!) = a(120) = 168 = 120+(2*4!) and a(8!) = a(40320) = 30240 = 40320-(2*7!).

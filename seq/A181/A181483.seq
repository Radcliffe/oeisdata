%N A181483 Number of powers of 2 which can be subtracted from 3^n to form primes.
%C A181483 Note that if a 2^m is too large or too small, 3^n-2^m is either negative or fractional (respectively) and cannot ever be prime, thus 0 <= a(n) <= floor(n*log_2(3))
%C A181483 Zeros in this sequence are in A181484, which correspond to -1s in A180303
%e A181483 3^1-2^0 = 2 which is prime, so a(1)=1
%e A181483 3^3-{2^4,2^3,2^2,2^1,2^0} = {11,19,23,25,26}, three of which are prime, so a(3) = 3

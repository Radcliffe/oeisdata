%N A386984 Number of 2-dense sublists of divisors of the n-th hexagonal number.
%C A386984 In a sublist of divisors of k the terms are in increasing order and two adjacent terms are the same two adjacent terms in the list of divisors of k.
%C A386984 The 2-dense sublists of divisors of k are the maximal sublists whose terms increase by a factor of at most 2.
%C A386984 Conjecture: all terms are odd.
%F A386984 a(n) = A237271(A000384(n)) for n >= 1 (conjectured).
%e A386984 For n = 3 the third positive hexagonal number is 15. The list of divisors of 15 is [1, 3, 5, 15]. There are three 2-dense sublists of divisors of 15, they are [1], [3, 5], [15], so a(3) = 3.
%Y A386984 Bisection of A384928.

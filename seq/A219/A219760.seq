%N A219760 Martin Gardner's minimal no-3-in-a-line problem.
%C A219760 a(n) is the minimal number of counters that can be placed on an n X n chessboard, no three in a line, such that adding one more counter on any vacant square will produce three in a line.
%C A219760 From _Rob Pratt_, Mar 29 2014: (Start)
%C A219760 Can be computed by using integer linear programming (ILP) as follows.
%C A219760 The ILP formulation uses two sets of binary decision variables:
%C A219760 x[i,j] = 1 if a queen appears in square (i,j), 0 otherwise
%C A219760 y[k] = 1 if line k contains exactly two queens, 0 otherwise
%C A219760 Let SQUARES[k] be the set of squares that appear in line k, and let LINES[i,j] be the set of lines that contain square (i,j), so that (i,j) is in SQUARES[k] iff k is in LINES[i,j].  Then we have the following constraints:
%C A219760 2 y[k] <= sum {(i,j) in SQUARES[k]} x[i,j] <= 1 + y[k] for all lines k [no 3-in-a-line, and if y[k] = 1 then exactly two queens appear in line k]
%C A219760 x[i,j] + sum {k in LINES[i,j]} y[k] >= 1 for all squares (i,j) [either a queen appears in square (i,j) or some line that contains square (i,j) contains exactly two queens]
%C A219760 The objective is to minimize the sum of all x[i,j].
%C A219760 (End)
%C A219760 From _Don Knuth_, Aug 26 2014: (Start)
%C A219760 a(26)=26: there is a solution in which every queen appears in an odd-numbered row and an odd-numbered column, and furthermore cell (i,j) is occupied if and only if cell (j,i) is occupied. Such solutions exist when n=10, 18, 26. Conversely it's known that a(n)>=n when n is even.
%C A219760 There are many ways to place n+1 queens that satisfy the conditions, with queens occupying only "white" squares (if the top left corner square is white), at least for n<=30.
%C A219760 (End)
%C A219760 This is for the "queens" version of the problem, where "lines" are vertical, horizontal and diagonal only.  The version where lines can have any slope is A277433. - _Robert Israel_, Oct 26 2016

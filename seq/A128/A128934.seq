%N A128934 Number of centrist groupoids with n elements.
%C A128934 Systems with a binary operation that satisfies AB.BA=B. The rule is anti-commutative. Any central groupoid is centrist.
%C A128934 For comparison, a central groupoid is a system with a binary operator that satisfies the equation AB.BC=B (or (AB)(BC)=B). These have the curious property that the finite systems have a square number of elements. What is the beginning of the sequence giving the number of central groupoids of order n^2?

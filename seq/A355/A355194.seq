%N A355194 The number of evenly tagged partitions: partitions of n elements together with an involution defined on the set of classes which has at most one fixed point, such that a class and its image have the same number of elements.
%C A355194 a(n) is also the number of subspaces of R^n given by coordinate equalities of the form x_i = x_j, x_i = -x_j and x_i = 0, that are orthogonal to the vector of all 1's.
%C A355194 These subspaces play an important role in the field of network dynamical systems, where they correspond to anti-synchronization. That is, they capture the phenomenon where different cells in a network show the same or opposite behavior.

%F A355194 E.g.f.: exp(I_0(2*z)/2 - 1/2 + z), where I_0 is the modified Bessel function of the first kind.
%F A355194 a(0) = 1, a(n+1) = a(n) + Sum_{k>=0, m>=0, k + 2*m + 1 = n} (n!/(k!*m!*(n-k-m)!))*a(k).
%e A355194 The set {1,2} has the trivial partition consisting only of the class {1,2}, together with the involution that sends {1,2} to itself. There is also the singleton partition with classes {1} and {2}, together with the involution that maps {1} to {2} and vice versa. The other involution on the two classes {1} and {2} has two fixed points and is therefore not counted, Hence, we find a(2) = 2.
%e A355194 Alternatively, in R^2 we have two subspaces given by coordinate equalities of the form x_i = x_j, x_i = -x_j and x_i = 0, that are orthogonal to the vector (1,1). These are the zero-space and the subspace given by x_1 = -x_2. In R^3 we find the zero-space and the three subspaces given by x_i = -x_j, x_k = 0 for {i,j,k} = {1,2,3}. This shows that a(3) = 4.

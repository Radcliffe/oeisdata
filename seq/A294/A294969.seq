%N A294969 Decimal expansion of sqrt(14)/2 = sqrt(7/2) = A010471/2.
%C A294969 The regular continued fraction of sqrt(14)/2 is [1, repeat(1, 6, 1, 2)].
%C A294969 The convergents are given in A295336/A295337.
%C A294969 sqrt(14)/2 appears in a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle of radius 1 unit in the following way. Draw a straight line through two opposed midpoints of a side (halving the hexagon). The length between one of the midpoints, say M, and one of the two vertices nearest to the opposed midpoint is sqrt(13)/2 = A295330 units. A circle through M with this length ratio sqrt(13)/2 intersects the line below the hexagon at a point, say P. Then the length ratio between P and one of the two vertices nearest to M is sqrt(14)/2 (from a right triangle (1/2, sqrt(13)/2, sqrt(14)/2)).
